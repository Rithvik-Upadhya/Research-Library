Client Name: [Centre for Pastoralism](https://centreforpastoralism.org)

Deployed on [Netlify](https://cfp-research-library.netlify.app/)

Branch Info: Original code that pulls data directly from Zotero without an intermediate database. Refactored in main later to use MongoDB for the databse and Netlify serverless functions as a makeshift backend to keep MongoDB in sync with Zotero.
