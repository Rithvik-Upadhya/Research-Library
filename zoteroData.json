The pastoralist communities of India have bred and nurtured several breeds of domesticated animals, and these pastoral systems house precious genetic resource which needs to be conserved and registered.\nSahjeevan, an organization based in Gujarat, organized an exhibition on Pastoralism in 2016. This exhibition led to formation of Center For Pastoralism, New Delhi an organization with a mandate to work on pastoral issues across India.\nResearch during the exhibition pointed to a diminishing indigenous wool economy, and this was a major source of discontent for sheep herders. CFP commissioned a study in 2018 to explore and understand the dynamics of the local sheep wool economies in different parts of India.\nThe first phase of the study focused on sheep herding systems in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttrakhand.\nA second phase of the study is scheduled to be commissioned in May 2019.

Indigenous livestock breeding systems rely mostly on qualitative traits than pure quantitative qualities. Qualitative traits are difficult to measure and most of the indigenous knowledge systems are in forms of qualitative traits. The lack of documentation and predominant qualitative nature makes it difficult to validate the ITK related to livestock breeding. In the current study, an attempt was made to validate ITK related to breeding of two indigenous draught power cattle breeds, Poda Thurpu and Nallamala-Kamma cattle, by the indigenous cattle breeders of two districts of Nagarkurnool and Kurnool, of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively. QuIK (Quantification of indigenous knowledge) method was adopted for validation of ITK related to cattle breeding. Primary data (predominantly qualitative in nature) related to the criteria for selection of breeding bulls and unique characteristics desired by the indigenous breeders in the breeding stock had been captured through personal interviews and focus group discussions. Inductive coding method was adopted for generating codes naturally from the data itself. Based on the codes, pertinent biometry data of 595 cattle was collected to validate the ITK related to indigenous cattle breeding and management. Findings of the study suggests that over 90 percent of the cattle population of both the breeds show unique characteristics desired by the indigenous breeders.",

Such breeds will survive only when indigenous knowledge systems in which they have been embedded also survives. Modern livestock breeding and development programmes, however, heavily rely on only a handful of livestock breeds and genes, with narrow range of quantitative traits such as – quick growth and weight gain, etc. Further, such development programmes and associated extension and delivery systems seldom acknowledge the role of indigenous socio-cultural, traditional economic, and indigenous knowledge systems in improvement and conservation of indigenous livestock breeds and germ plasm. A study was conducted in eleven districts of the Indian state of Maharashtra to examine the relationship and embeddedness of a specific indigenous livestock breed within the socio-cultural landscape of its custodian indigenous community. Results of the study suggest that Indigenous livestock management systems are highly evolved and well positioned for improvement and sustainable management of both the indigenous livestock and associated genetic resources. However, indigenous knowledge on animal breeding is often “tacit” and not necessarily an expressed knowledge. Unlike modern science, the indigenous livestock management systems rely mostly on qualitative traits. Acknowledgement of their role and a little encouragement through designing inclusive institutions, extension services and delivery mechanisms could take improvement and conservation of indigenous livestock breeds/populations a long way.",

There is a dearth of disaggregated data of the actual number of people/communities actively engaged in extensive pastoralism in the country. In this context, a study was conducted on extensive pastoralism in the Deccan Plateau region with an objective to abridge the knowledge and information gaps existing in extensive pastoralism of this region. The study was covers four districts of Telangana and one district of Andhra Pradesh state of India. Pastoral communities associated with management of three indigenous cattle populations (Poda Thurpu, Nallamala-Pasa and Vandhera) maintained under mobile pastoralist system were recruited for purpose of the study. Overall, 16 communities including both traditional and non-traditional pastoral communities are practicing mobile pastoralism in the study region. The indigenous nomadic Banjara community was found to be the major community involved in mobile pastoralism in the study area. Population of the three indigenous cattle breeds covered in the study was found to be less than 10,000, therefore, there is a need for taking measures for conservation of these cattle breeds. Similar to other parts of the country, mobile pastoralism in the study area is in decline and under stress from different drivers, which includes impositions of the forest department on access to customary grazing lands, shrinkage of commons among others.",

About 17 - 24 percent of the geographical area of the country is covered under semi-arid savannah grasslands (SSGs), (Paul and Vanak, 2020; ATREE, 2019; Ghosh, 2017; TERI, 2017). Grasslands of India are classified into six major types , the alpine grasslands of the Himalayas, the flooded wet grasslands of the Terai region and the widespread semi-arid grasslands of the Deccan Plateau region of the peninsular India.  The morphology of these grasslands could be attributed to poor soils, low rainfall and/or natural and anthropogenic caused fires, which prevents them from succession into a woodland (Shabuddin, 2015). The diverse, widespread, extremely important but sensitive grassland ecosystems of the country are in grave danger from multiple threats ranging from lack of proper policies, mismanagement, poor understanding, encroachment, and diversion for economic pursuits of the national interest.",

But high-profile debates, based on patchy evidence, are failing to differentiate between varied landscapes, environments and production methods. Relatively low-impact, extensive livestock production, such as pastoralism, is being lumped in with industrial systems in the conversation about the future of food. This report warns that the dominant picture of livestock’s impacts on climate change has been distorted by faulty assumptions that focus on intensive, industrial farming in rich countries. Millions of people worldwide who depend on extensive livestock production, with relatively lower climate impacts, are being ignored by debates on the future of food. The report identifies ten flaws in the way that livestock’s climate impacts have been assessed, and suggests how pastoralists could be better included in future debates about food and the climate.",

They, play an important role in the livelihood of not only the indigenous pastoralist communities but also of a large proportion of small and marginal farmers and landless.\nIndia is internationally renowned for its indigenous cattle and ovine diversity, however more than 50% of indigenous sheep breeds are under serious threat. In addition, characterization of the indigenous sheep breeds was done more than half a century ago. The surveys conducted in majority of the regions/breeds are far from complete and information on recent estimates are unavailable (Bhatia and Arora, 2005). Adding to the already grim picture is the serious threat of genetic erosion and contamination from intermixing of nearby breeds, introduction of exotic breeds, crossbreeding and artificial insemination programmes of the government and changes in farming, land-tenure system have led to the decline in purebred population and dilution of genetic merit.

The term biocultural diversity is assuming significance in science, practice and policy. Maffi (2007), defines biocultural diversity as\n   \nmanifestations:biological,cultural, andlinguistic— which are interrelated (and possibly\n\"the diversity of life in all its\ncoevolved) within a complex socio-ecological adaptive system.” Further, Maffi (2012),\nelucidates that biocultural diversity can be understood as \"The diversity of life is made up not\nonly of the diversity of plants and animal species, habitats and ecosystems found on the\nplanet, but also of the diversity of human cultures and languages.\"",

The Nagpuri buffalo breed do not produce as much milk as the Murrah or Jaffarabadi buffalo breeds. However, they need not be fed as much as the cross breeds and are easy to maintain with very little inputs. The Nanda Gaoli community has many unique and interesting traditions and customs. In addition to the many rituals and festivals that are similar to the mainstream society, a few are found to be observed only by the Nanda Gaoli community. For instance, the Bhaladev festival, the festival of grass, grasslands, and grazing cattle in the forests (Kalokar and Siripurapu, 2020) and the practice of devoting cattle or buffalo to God as the sacred animal. A buffalo that is devoted to the God is considered holy and fondly addressed by the Nanda Gaoli people as “Jaani”.",

To get a deeper understanding of the sustainability concerns in the cashmere industry, it is important to understand the cashmere supply chain operations to uncover the key sustainability issues prevalent in the present-day traditional cashmere industry. For this, a single case study was conducted in Kashmir, India using qualitative approaches. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured interviews, observations, cashmere retailer websites and documentary evidence. Due to the impact of mechanization and lack of industry standards, the research ﬁndings indicate deteriorating socio-economic conditions of the artisans; especially, women spinners and weavers. Mechanization promotes economic sustainability for the manufacturers and retailers which helps them strengthen their market base. However, with this, artisan communities are rendered jobless who are dependent on their manual skills for sustenance as they have limited alternate revenue generation options. Moreover, the lack of motivation among the artisans to use institutional support further escalates sustainability concerns in the traditional craft industry.",

The continuing strength of these assumptions is demonstrated by the contemporary marketing in 2001 of pashmina (\"woven goat hair\" or cashmere) shawls, using the recycled tropes of exoticism and fantasy ethnography crafted during the heyday of British colonialism.",

Eight regional desk studies were conducted: (1) Southern Africa and the Horn, (2) West Africa, (3) East Africa, (4) North Africa, (5) South America, (6) Asia, (7) the Middle East, and (8) Europe. The studies sought to identify the contribution of pastoralism to domestic and global markets, by gathering productivity indicators and market behaviour, and identifying indirect values and methodologies for analysing indirect values. This review is intended to add to the global understanding on the importance of mobile pastoralism as a form of productive and sustainable land management. By gathering information, the review highlights existing knowledge on the value of pastoralism, gaps in this knowledge, trends in pastoral economies, and policy options that can support rangeland economies most effectively. Presented here is a summary of the main points relating to economic valuation of mobile pastoralism.",

Least square means ±SE of pashmina (Kashmir-cashmere) yields year−1 in adult goats at first, second, third, fourth and fifth clips were 78 ± 6 g, 159 ± 9 g, 227 ± 9 g, 191 ± 10 g and 195 ± 20 g, respectively. The coefficient of heritability of pashmina yield in the first clip at 1 year of age was high (0.91 ± 0.51).

The research forms the basis of a doctoral dissertation in human geography, focusing on the rural to urban migration of nomads in Ladakh. The study\n uses the theoretical literature on human migration to examine the sedentarisation process that has gained momentum in the latter decades of the Twentieth Century. The sedentarisation of nomadic pastoralists in Ladakh is taking place amidst a global trend toward settlement (Barfield 1993; Blench\n 2001). Despite a few exceptions, where pastoralism either continues to thrive or is being revitalised by market reforms, many nomadic pastoral communities are facing an unprecedented rate of change, as they are increasingly drawn into national economies.",

        "abstractNote": "The Buddhist Changpas-pastoral nomads of Changthang, Ladakh form an ethnic entity. Like other nomads in the world, the pastoral nomads of Changthang are a minority, suffering problems of under representation, social, economic and geographic marginalisation. The region is extremely poor in conventional energy sources (fossils, fuel and wood) and has almost no industrially exploitable resources. Natural environmental limitations dictate many aspects of traditional life, especially settlement pattern and economic system. Among the Changpas, the pastoral mode of livelihood is an evident attempt to adapt to a natural environment, which provides no plants as food that can support humans and has no potential for growing food crops. Under such conditions, the only solution is to domesticate large herds of various animals, which can feed off the plants and in return, the animals can sustain humans. Since, the ecological conditions of Changthang are not favourable for crop growing, the Changpas raise large herds of sheep and goats as well as transport animals like yaks and horses. These animals provide the Changpas with meat, milk, varieties of wool, which they use themselves and barter for grains and other utilities. This economic interdependence of nomadic pastoral and settled population has been an important characteristic of the society in this area. The Changpas social behaviour is, in part, a response to constraints and opportunities of the natural environment. Both stability and change are outcomes of response to the immediate needs of daily life. The basic form of social organisation in the area was rural, and social relations among the agriculturalists, nomadic and semi-nomadic groups were based on trade and exchange of essential commodities. The Changpas’ subsistence level pastoral economy, traditional social and religio-cultural systems are composite part of cold desert’s ecological system. Their way of life shows a capacity to adapt themselves to the rugged cold desert environment. The Changpas possess a high degree of specialised knowledge and a flexible social organisation to make viable the mobile mode of production. Despite the ecological constraints, the Changpas were managing their environment for making a living without outside intervention. Their own societal controls like polyandry and cutting of excess animals, helped in turn by their customary rights and equity in resource allocation has helped them. The Changpas are organised using a patrilineal idiom, all members being patrilineal descendants of the founding ancestor. Rangeland, livestock, manpower and the considerable knowledge of the skills necessary to exploit them effectively are the principle economic resources of the Changpas of Changthang. Resource management in a risky environment illustrates the skills of the Changpas for survival. Traditional practices of Changpas, such as the rotation of grazing areas and use of reserve pastures in case of natural calamities help manage the variability of ecosystem and bail out pastures from a state of permanent degradation. Each animal has its own specific characteristics and adaptation to the environment. Rearing together different animals maximised the use of vegetation in the pasture. Different animals graze on different plants. In recent decades, the Changpas of Changthang have been experiencing changes due to external pressures that have altered political, economic and social landscapes. Traditionally, the Changpas were self-sufficient and livestock were providing them with their food and lodging. In recent decades, continuous massive defense investments and improvement in communications; proliferation of government departments; introduction of development plans; provision for basic amenities, alterations in traditional subsistence economy, its commercialisation and extension of know-how through government departments and non-government organisations and tourism has led to a higher motivation among local people for better standards of living. Increasing administrative and market integration and population growth over the years have weakened socio-homeostasis with no functional substitutes for restoring positive social system. For centuries, pastoralists in Changthang have lived in the context of environmental uncertainty and have developed a diverse range of strategies, institutions and network to minimise this unpredict-ability and risk. Pastoral management strategies, which may have worked previously, may or may not be sufficient now. The three communities of Samad, Korzok and Kharnak responded differently to these changes. Various pressures with an ever-increasing rate of change necessitated the adoption of new strategies for survival.",

While conducting ecological studies on the rangelands of Changthang, eastern Ladakh, we assessed the above-ground biomass and nutrient quality of Eurotia ceratoides Mey (Chenopodiaceae), a common shrub in the area, following standard methods. Its density, cover and biomass were highest in the lower slopes and sandy plains, while it was completely absent in the marsh meadows. Nutritive quality of Eurotia was found to be significantly (P < 0.005) higher compared to other dominant species. As expected, a seasonal variation in nutrients was found. Crude protein content decreased from 21% in summer to 12% in winter, whereas anti-quality factors increased during winter. Patterns and processes of Eurotia degradation and its implications for the management of rangelands are discussed.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper deals with the floristic structure and plant-community composition in relation to environmental gradients in the Tso Kar basin, an --300 km2 area of the Changthang plateau. A total of 131 sites covering various landscape units-namely, sandy plains, marsh meadows, moist meadows, scrub steppe, fell-fields, and stream courses-were intensively sampled by using random quadrats of 1 m2. In addition, these sites were searched for the presence of other vascular plants. In all, 232 species of vascular plants belonging to 38 families and 101 genera were collected and recorded from the study area. Poaceae (39 species), Asteraceae (27 species), Cyperaceae (25 species), Brassicaceae (14 species), Fabaceae (12 species), and Ranunculaceae (12 species) are the dominant families. It is interesting to note that the study area has a very high monocot:dicot ratio (1:2). Analysis of Raunkiaer's life-forms reveals that the area is dominated by two growth forms-namely, 57% hemicryptophytes (perennial grasses and sedges) and 24% chamaephytes (dwarf herbs and matted shrubs). The density of stems ranges from 28 to 744 plants per square meter. Species richness varies from 4 to 15, and diversity values are from 0.143 to 1.679. Among communities, the highest similarity (57.5%) is between ScirpusCarex and Scirpus-Kobresia-Ranunculus. Conservation implications of the findings and the need for a participatory approach of the rangeland management are discussed.",

Yak represents a major mammal species of the rangelands found across the Asian highlands from Russia and Kyrgyzstan in the west to the Hengduan Mountains of China in the east. Yak also has great cultural significance to the people of the Asian highlands and is closely interlinked to the traditions, cultures, and rituals of the herding communities. However, increasing issues like poverty, environmental degradation, and climate change have changed the traditional practices of pastoralism, isolating and fragmenting herders and the pastures they have been using for many years. Local cultures of people rooted in the practice of yak herding are disappearing. Therefore, it is very important to document the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of yak herding. The broad aim of this paper was to provide a brief overview on the geographical distribution of yak in the Asian highlands and to provide in-depth information on yak-herding ethnic communities, the sociocultural aspect associated with yak herding, and challenges and emerging opportunities for yak herding in the Asian highlands. Altogether, 31 ethnic groups in 10 different countries of Asia and their cultures are documented herein. Yak was found to be utilized for many different household purposes, and to have cultural and religious aspects. Unfortunately, yak rearing and related traditions have been losing their charm in recent years due to modernization and several other environmental issues. Lastly, we suggest that there is an urgent need to take action to minimize the challenges faced by yak-herding mountain communities to conserve the traditional pastoral system and associated cultures of these ethnic communities.",

        "abstractNote": "As drivers of terrestrial ecosystems, humans have replaced large carnivores in most areas, and human influence not only exerts striking ecological pressures on biodiversity at local scales but also has indirect effects in distant comers of the world. We suggest that the multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in Central Asia. This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data, ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates, and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our hypothesis. In Mongolia increases in domestic goat production were associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders coexisting with endangered saiga (Saiga tatarica). That increasing domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment among blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in trans-Himalayan India. Across 7 study areas in Mongolia, India, and China's Tibetan Plateau, native ungulate biomass is now <5% that of domestic species. Such trends suggest ecosystem degradation and decreased capacity for the persistence of native species, including at least 8 Asian endemic species: saiga, chiru (Pantholops hodgsoni), Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), khulan (Equus hemionus), kiang (E. kiang), takhi (E. przewalski), and wild yak (Bos mutus). Our results suggest striking yet indirect and unintended actions that link trophic-level effects to markets induced by the trade for cashmere.",

Our objective is to document the enormous variety of adaptations and strategies that pastoralists in South Asia have crafted to address variations\n in the environmental, social and political risks they confront. Their actions belie the common image of pastoralists as irrational, whimsical and politically passive migrants. Instead, it reveals them as consciously pursuing a variety of sophisticated strategies. The articles in this issue\n also document precisely how many pastoralists work with states, with markets and as communities as they pursue their livelihoods and organise socio-politically.",

It is endeavoured here to make an appraisal of the oral traditions and cults of the Kuruvas, the sheep pastoralists inhabiting the semi-arid regions of the southern Deccan, in the light of archaeological evidence. These studies point out that the antiquity of the sheep pastoral system in this region, plausibly goes back to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic times, in that it developed as an offshoot of the sedentary village based cattle keepingcum- agricultural system. The sheep pastoral system, since its inception, also drew into its fold the hill and forest tribes and this is evidenced by the enactment of rituals associated with hunting, in the otherwise Sanskritized religion of these communities, as well as one of the wives of their god who belongs to a hill/forest tribe.",

The first is that democratic governments can restrict human resource use within protected areas, and the second is that human land use for subsistence leads to degradation and is incompatible wvith the maintenance of high levels of biological diversity. An examination of officialpolicy documents over the past century indicates that Gaddi herders of Himachal Pradesh, northwestern Indian Himalaya, have used political influence to circumvent bureaucratic policies of exclusion and that there is an absence of scientific evidence to support the notion that Gaddi grazing leads to land degradation. Although grazing intensity has profoundly shaped the strtucture and comp)osition of the Siwalik forests (the Gaddi winter grazing grounds), as demonstrated by transect-based data presented here, deviations from a supposed \"climax\" community need not constitute degradation. A growving rather than declining cattle population attests to the regenerative capacities of these forests. Withini the alpine meadows grazed by the Gaddi in summer, mean plant species richness increased along transects originating at herder camps and extending 250 in north of herder cam]p sites. Intense grazing pressure or heavy manuring by livestock bedded at night are likeljy to be responsible for the observed low species diversity adjacent to the campsite, but the effect is insignificanit at the level of the overall landscape. Interviews with herders also suggest the presence of a sizable, though hunted, mammalian fauna in these high altitude meadows. Recognition of the difficulties associated with implementing restrictive policies, and the fact that buman land-use practices need not lead to degradation or to a decline in biological diversity, should lead to more inclusive conservation policies within protected areas as well as an expansion of the conservation focus beyond protected-area boundaries.",

We then apply this conceptual framework to an archaeological site also found in Gujarat, Bagasra, in order to explore probable dynamics of the ancient pastoral system in relation to resources accessibility and mobility. Dealing with archaeological past is always difficult given the limited availability of data. We argue that the conceptual approach proposed here allow us to draw some hypotheses about adaptation strategies, for which it appears a relevant way to further explore the dynamics of ancient pastoral systems.",

Customary grazing patterns of both herders and cultivators reflected both horizontal and vertical access to pastoral resources in the mountain commons. Such institutions of usage were designed over the years by constant and mutual adjustment during different seasons in the year and in pastures spread over varied elevations. Consequently the institutions of transhumance provided insurance against specific risks and preparation against general uncertainty prevailing in the Himalayas. The gains from such practices were shared by the commoners, both cultivators and herders.\" These usages were relatively untouched by outside influences till the nineteenth century. External factors began to exert pressure when change in the political economy in the northern plains affected the character of risk and changed the nature of uncertainty. Further, growth in numbers of both humans and animals in the herd altered the ecological balance on the commons. Thus began the erosion of customary institutions which regulated herding and agricultural practices in the mountains.\" This paper will attempt to map firstly the nature of customary usage on the pastoral commons both vertical and horizontal and examine the relation between these institutions and natural ecology; secondly, it will try to assess the disturbance to these institutions caused by firstly, forest reservation made by the Department of Forests; secondly, by statutory intervention like forest law; and thirdly by the capture of water-sheds of rivers on mountain systems like the Himalayas.\"",

The basis of their economic activities is buffalo herds and they are specialised producers of dairy products which are sold in local towns. The Gujars do not themselves own any land and do not practise agriculture, and are therefore dependent upon access to state forests where they live for most of the year. Their lifestyle has come into collision with the state through the regulation of the traditional use of Indian forests. This has meant a remarkable impoverishment for the Gujars who are rapidly loosing their traditional pasture land and calling into debt. Their position as outsiders in Indian society is putting a lot of pressure on their traditional society and internal solidarity.",

Mitigation measures proposed by conservation agencies, however, are often technocratic and perceived as being an external imposition on the local community. Herders affected by the depredation may have the knowledge to design locally relevant solutions, but they might lack financial and technical support to implement these effectively. Their inability to act can result in the communities being viewed as antagonistic rather than a part of the solution. We present a case study on co-development of a conservation intervention by a traditional pastoral community together with a conservation NGO, to mitigate livestock depredation inside night-time corrals in Ladakh, India. Between January and June 2020, livestock corrals in Sumdoo TR village were attacked 10 times by carnivores such as snow leopards and wolves, killing over 100 sheep, goat, yak, and horses and causing loses of over 10,400 USD. Local people were agitated, and there were strong demands for capture or removal of the carnivores from the area. We operationalized the PARTNERS (Presence, Aptness, Respect, Transparency, Negotiation, Empathy, Responsiveness, and Strategic Support) principles framework for community-based conservation to help the village effectively implement an intervention based on a novel predator-proof corral design conceptualized by the community. We demonstrate that empowering the community to design and implement a conservation intervention helped them take ownership of the effort, improve trust with conservation agencies, and hence likely to be a long-term solution to conservation conflicts in the region. Our approach of using the PARTNERS principles has relevance for conservation agencies who are trying to implement interventions, particularly those geared toward reducing livestock depredation by carnivores. Our approach further helps communities to view themselves as part of the solution and not the problem.",

This paper will look at the relationship between the Van Gujjars and their forest base in a historical perspective from colonial rule to ‘conservation of nature’ and the ‘rights of forest dwellers’ and further discuss how changing codes and rules of power affect the society–citizen–nature / forest relationship for the community. We will look back into history and see how a system of strict control and regulation of Van Gujjars as nomadic pastoralists without a ﬁxed address, initiated during colonial time, was continued by the national state of India after independence. We will further discuss how a history of unequal treatment and marginalisation of Van Gujjar pastoralists has continued into the present. What is manifest here is ‘the forest’ as a contested space: a site of power struggles, where forest dwellers are threatened with displacement in order to provide space, ﬁrst for modern forestry and revenue producing land, and later for conservation of nature. The paper further looks at the latest developments where the Van Gujjars now have obtained domicile rights such as voters’ rights and have been linked with Government services for education and health. It ﬁnishes by discussing the new possibilities and hopes for the community provided by the The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act.",

The 'old paradigm' in range ecology depended on three main sets of actors: (i) range ecologists who believed in Clement's (1916) model of succession and ecological stability; (ii) economists who believed in Hardin's (1968) concepts of the 'tragedy of the commons'; and (iii) authoritarian administrations which saw pastoralists as backward and destructive, and which had the power and the structures to use and perpetuate scientific paradigms. The so-called 'new paradigm' sees semi-arid ecosystems as being in permanent disequilibrium but persistent on broad temporal and spatial scales whilst many indigenous pastoral strategies are carefully adapted to these characteristics.]",

Based on qualitative research in Gouli Township, Qinghai province, China, we analyze the context in which Tibetan herders make decisions, and their decisions about livestock and pastures. We refute three fundamental assumptions upon which current policy is premised: that pastoralists aim to increase livestock numbers without limit; that, blindly following tradition, they do not actively manage livestock and rangelands; and that they lack environmental knowledge. We demonstrate that pastoralists carefully assess limits to livestock holdings based on land and labor availability; that they increasingly manage their livestock and rangelands through contracting; and that herding knowledge is a form of embodied practical skill. We further discuss points of convergence and contradiction between herders’ observations and results of a vegetation analysis.",

Pastoralism is the dominant land use type across the distributional range of the endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia. Snow leopards are often killed in retaliation against livestock depredation. Whether livestock, by forming an alternative prey, could potentially benefit snow leopards, or, whether livestock use of an area is detrimental to snow leopards is poorly understood. We examined snow leopard habitat use in a multiple use landscape that was comprised of sites varying in livestock abundance, wild prey abundance and human population size. We photographically sampled ten sites (average size 70sq. km) using ten camera traps in each site, deployed for a period of 60days. Snow leopard habitat use was computed as a Relative Use Index based on the total independent photographic captures and the number of snow leopard individuals captured at each site. We quantified livestock abundance, wild prey abundance, human population size and terrain ruggedness in each of the sites. Key variables influencing snow leopard habitat use were identified using Information Theory based model selection approach. Snow leopard habitat use was best explained by wild prey density, and showed a positive linear relationship with the abundance of wild ungulates. We found a hump-shaped relationship between snow leopard habitat use and livestock stocking density, with an initial increase in habitat use followed by a decline beyond a threshold of livestock density. Our results suggest that in the absence of direct persecution of snow leopards, livestock grazing and snow leopard habitat use are potentially compatible up to a certain threshold of livestock density, beyond which habitat use declines, presumably due to depressed wild ungulate abundance and associated anthropogenic disturbance.",

We suggest that the multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in Central Asia. This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data, ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates, and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our hypothesis. In Mongolia increases in domestic goat production were associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders coexisting with endangered saiga (Saiga tatarica).That increasing domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment among blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur)in trans-Himalayan India. Across 7 study areas in Mongolia, India, and China's Tibetan Plateau, native ungulate biomass is now <5% that of domestic species. Such trends suggest ecosystem degradation and decreased capacity for the persistence of native species, including at least 8 Asian endemic species: saiga, chiru (Pantholops hodgsoni), Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus), snow leopard(Panthera uncia), khulan(Equus hemionus), kiang (E. kiang), takhi (E. przewalski), and wild yak (Bos mutus). Our results suggest striking yet indirect and unintended actions that link trophic-level effects to markets induced by the trade for cashmere.

        "abstractNote": "Herding in Himalayan alpine pastures is as \"old as the hills.\" As such practices could not have been sustained unless the pastures, in both the Himalaya and the plains of northern India, had been sustained, the claims of the Gaddi shepherds to both horizontal and vertical access to pastoral resources in the mountain commons are founded upon long-standing customary usage. These practices were sustained by institutions of transhumance, a response to ecological demands whose design rested on constant and mutual adjustment between herding and cultivation, in both mountains and plains, to insure against specific seasonal risks and enhance preparedness against general uncertainty at different elevations. Such collective behavior was possible because of the complementary demands of the herders in the mountains and the cultivators in the valleys and plains. The gains from such practices for both groups induced each to uphold its own responsibilities. In the process, the ecological balance in the environment was sustained. Since the nineteenth century, alterations in the political economy of the northern plains have changed the character of risk and shifted the nature of uncertainty. Dams, plantation forests, and canals have changed the plains and upset the ecological balance of their relations with the Himalaya. Increase in numbers of both humans and animals has also altered the ecological balance on the commons. The customary institutions which had regulated herding and agricultural practices in the mountains have been eroded. This paper maps the nature of customary usage on the pastoral commons; examines the relation between these institutions and human and natural ecology; assesses the change in the nature of risk and uncertainty consequent to statutory and developmental interventions by the State; and advocates policy directions. /// La garde des troupeaux dans les pâturages alpestres de l'Himalaya est une activité aussi \"vieille que les montagnes\". Puisque ces pratiques ne pouvaient être maintenues à moins que les pâturages de l'Himalaya et des plaines du nord de l'Inde ne soient préservés, la revendication par les bergers Gaddis de l'accès à la fois horizontal et vertical aux ressources pastorales des communaux de montagne sont fondées sur un usage coutumier de longue date. Ces pratiques ont été maintenues par des institutions de transhumance, une réponse à des revendications d'ordre écologique dont le cadre reposait sur un ajustement constant et mutuel entre la garde des troupeaux et la culture des terres, à la fois dans les montagnes et dans les plaines, afin de prévenir les risques saisonniers spécifiques et de mieux se préparer à l'incertitude générale à différentes élévations. Cette attitude collective a été possible grce aux revendications complémentaires des gardiens de troupeaux des montagnes et des cultivateurs des vallées et des plaines. Les gains tirés des ces pratiques ont amené chacun des deux groupes à assumer leurs responsabilités respectives. Ainsi, l'équilibre écologique de l'environnement a été maintenu. Depuis le dix-neuvième siècle, les changements de l'économie politique dans les plaines du nord ont modifié le caractère du risque et la nature de l'incertitude. Les barrages, les forêts de plantations et les canaux out changé les plaines et rompu l'équilibre écologique de leurs relations avec l'Himalaya. L'augmentation du nombre d'humains et d'animaux a également modifié l'équilibre écologique des communaux. Les institutions coutumières qui réglementaient la garde des troupeaux et les pratiques agricoles dans les montagnes ont été affaiblies. Cet exposé présente la nature de l'usage coutumier sur les communaux pastoraux, examine la relation entre ces institutions et l'écologie humaine et naturelle, évalue le changement de la nature du risque et de l'incertitude résultant des interventions de l'État sur le plan statutaire et du développement et préconise des orientations politiques. /// Das Hüten von Vieh auf den Hochgebirgsweiden des Himalaya ist so alt wie die Berge selbst. Da man solche Praktiken auf Dauer jedoch nicht hätte beibehalten können, wären nicht die Weiden sowohl im Himalaya als such in den Ebenen Nordindiens erhalten worden, begründen die Gaddi-Hirten ihre Ansprüche auf horizontale und vertikale Nutzung der Bergweiden mit dem Gewohnheitsrecht. Diese Nutzungsformen wurden von Transhumanz-Institutionen aufrecht erhalten; eine Lösung der ökologischen Anforderungen, die sowohl in den Bergen als auch in den Ebenen auf eine konstante und beiderseitige Anpassung zwischen Weiden und Anbau ausgerichtet war. Hierdurch war man gegen vestimmte jahreszeitlich bedingte Risiken geschützt und gegen die allgemeinen Unsicherheitsfaktoren der unterschiedlichen Höhenlagen besser gewappnet. Ein solches kollektives Verhalten wurde durch die sich gegenseitig ergänzenden Anforderungen der Viehhirten in den Bergen und der Bauern in den Tälern und Ebenen möglich. Der Nutzen, den beide Gruppen aus solchen Methoden zogen, veranlaßte sie, ihren jeweiligen Teil der Verantworking zu erfüllen. Dies führte dazu, daß das ökologische Gleichgewicht der Natur langfristig bewahrt wurde. Seit dem neunzehnten Jahrhundert haben sich durch Veränderungen in der politischen Wirtschaft die Art der Risiken geändert und die Gründe der Unsicherheitsfaktoren verlagert. Dämme, Baumplantagen und Kanäle haben die Ebenen verändert und ihr ökologisches Gleichgewicht mit dem Himalaya gestört. Der zahlenmäßige Anstieg der Bevölkerung und der Tierwelt hat das ökologische Gleichgewicht des Weidelandes verändert. Die im Gewohnheitsrecht verankerten Institutionen, die früher die Weide- und Landwirtschaftsnutzung in den Bergen regelten, wurden unterhöhlt. Der Text beschreibt die Charakteristiken der gewohnheit-srechtlichen Nutzung des Weidelandes, betrachtet die Relation zwischen den betreffenden Institutionen und menschlicher und natürlicher...kologie, bewertet die Veränderungen der Risiken und Unsicherheitsfaktoren im Verlauf der gesetzlichen und entwicklungstechnischen Interventionen durch den Staat und befürwortet politische Richtungen.",

        "abstractNote": "An emerging conflict with Trans-Himalayan pastoral communities in Ladakh’s Changthang Plateau threatens the conservation prospects of the kiang (Equus kiang) in India. It is locally believed that Changthang’s rangelands are overstocked with kiang, resulting in forage competition with livestock. Here, we provide a review and preliminary data on the causes of this conflict. Erosion of people’s tolerance of the kiang can be attributed to factors such as the loss of traditional pastures during an Indo-Chinese war fought in 1962, immigration of refugees from Tibet, doubling of the livestock population in about 20 years, and increasing commercialization of cashmere (pashmina) production. The perception of kiang overstocking appears misplaced, because our range-wide density estimate of 0.24 kiang km−2 (± 0.44, 95% CL) is comparable to kiang densities reported from Tibet. A catastrophic decline during the war and subsequent recovery of the kiang population apparently led to the overstocking perception in Ladakh. In the Hanle Valley, an important area for the kiang, its density was higher (0.56 km−2) although even here, we estimated the total forage consumed by kiang to be only 3–4% compared to 96–97% consumed by the large livestock population (78 km−2). Our analysis nevertheless suggests that at a localized scale, some herders do face serious forage competition from kiang in key areas such as moist sedge meadows, and thus management strategies also need to be devised at this scale. In-depth socioeconomic surveys are needed to understand the full extent of the conflicts, and herder-centered participatory resolution needs to be facilitated to ensure that a sustainable solution for livelihoods and kiang conservation is achieved.",

We attempt to identify the conditions in which certain demonstrably false ideas about environmental change have come to acquire validity in policy circles, while others, more correct and espoused by inhabitants, have been excluded from consideration and investigation.\nSeveral authors have recently spotlighted the presence of particular off-the-shelf ‘narratives’ current in development institutions, which come to define development problems and justify interventions, particularly in conditions where data is poor, time is short, national agendas are overruled and local consultation impossible (Hoben 1993; Roe 1991, 1995). Narrative construction is the stuff of synthesis overview writing within development agencies and policy research institutes, and of inter-agency analytical alignment in development approaches. Narratives help decision makers to fill confidently the gap between ignorance and expediency.",

        "abstractNote": "The paper attempts to understand the relation between pastoral cultures and irrigation-based intensive farming regimes promoted by modern development represented by the Indira Gandhi Canal (IGNP) in western Rajasthan. Participant observation and development practice engagement with pastoral communities over the past three decades give an opportunity to reflect on epistemic rationality that constitutes the discourse of modern development, formal statecraft of technocracy, and rule by experts. Historical markers of pastoralism in the interconnected regions of north-west Rajasthan and bordering regions of Multan and Bahawalpur in Pakistan are situated to trace the longuee duree of pastoral life systems in the Thar desert region. This oscillation between enhanced moisture regimes following inundation and increased desiccation of a moisture-deficient arid region has been at the core of sustaining the culture of pastoralism among semi-nomadic pastoralists of Muslim communities in north-west Rajasthan. The IGNP canal produces a space for modern development that opens up irrigated farming and an intensive natural resource use regime. This political economy of the IGNP canal systematically marginalizes pastoral natural resource use that was ecologically embedded. The varied experiences of adaptation responses by pastoral communities to this state-led marginalization points to the tenacious ability of pastoralism to continually adapt to the radically changing ecology. The paper argues for a complementarity of pastoral and farming use as an inclusive development vision. Beginnings can be made by a compassionate engagement with cultures of pastoralism that are endowed with resilience rooted in a historically constituted rationality to adapt and innovate with changing times. This may hold cues for a sustainable future of Thar.",

Through access mapping with commodity chain analysis, this study examines the distribution of benefits from Senegal's charcoal trade and the multiple market mechanisms underpinning that distribution. Benefits from charcoal are derived from direct control over forest access, as well as through access to markets, labour opportunities, capital, and state agents and officials. Access to these arenas is based on a number of inter-related mechanisms including legal property, social identity, social relations, coercion and information control. A commodity chain is the series of relations through which an item passes, from extraction through conversion, exchange, transport, distribution and final use. Access mapping involves evaluating the distribution of benefits along the chain, and tracing out the mechanisms by which access to benefits is maintained. It sheds light on the limited role of property, the embedded nature of markets, and the role of extra-legal structures and mechanisms in shaping equity and efficiency in resource use. It does so in a socially situated, multi-local manner, spanning the geographic spread of production and exchange. It also illuminates the practical issues surrounding establishment of community participation in benefits from and control over natural resources.",

We examined peoples’ attitudes in Buddhist (n = 83) and Muslim communities (n = 111) toward snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus) in Ladakh, India. We found that the eﬀect of religion on attitudes was statistically nonsigniﬁcant, and was tempered by gender, education, and awareness of wildlife laws. Even though religion by itself was not an indication of an individual’s attitude toward large carnivores, the extent to which he/she practiced it (i.e., religiosity) had a positive correlation with pro-carnivore attitudes in the case of Buddhist but not Muslim communities. Our ﬁndings indicate that it may be useful to integrate locally relevant religious philosophies into conservation practice. However, the emphasis of conservation messaging should vary, stressing environmental stewardship in the case of Islam, and human–wildlife interdependence in the case of Buddhism.",

        "abstractNote": "Concerns with the politics and practices of resource rights and access are integral to contemporary debates over environmental justice. Struggles over identity politics, especially the strategic articulation and deployment of particular identities at diverse geographical scales, have recently emerged as important mediators of justice claims in respect of resources rights, but also of recognition and procedural justice. To date, critical, multi-scalar analyses of identity-based claims for environmental justice have focused largely on the indigenous peoples’ movement. In doing so, they have failed to embrace an emergent dimension of identity-based, trans-scalar justice, namely the ﬂedgling global pastoralists’ movement, the empirical focus for this paper. In the early years of the 21st century mobile pastoralists have begun to carve out new global spaces, through which diverse groups have attempted to negotiate common ground and forge common identities in their struggles for justice. In particular, mobile pastoralists have become increasingly visible in conservation politics and contests over land rights as they lay claim to both discursive and material ground as ‘custodians of the commons’ in an era of global climatic change. This paper draws on empirical work amongst pastoralists, NGOs and activists from Kenya, Mongolia and Spain to explore these identities, their implications for resource rights and access and the multi-scalar chains of accountability and legitimacy between global activists and their local constituents.",

We ask how such a radical development has been possible in a country previously praised as a bulwark against radical Islam in Africa. While the dominant literature on the crisis in Mali has focused on how global political economic developments and international jihadist thinking and organisation relate to national dynamics, we take a materialist political ecology approach to explain the current situation. By focusing on the micro-politics of two land-use conflicts and how these conflicts are affected by the jihadist expansion, we seek to explain peasant (or pastoral) logics behind joining these armed groups. In particular, pastoralists seem to support the jihadist takeover, because of an anti-state, anti-elite and pro-pastoral jihadist discourse, because they have become increasingly fatigued by and disgruntled with a predatory and corrupt state, and because the development model imposed by the state and international donors has not responded to pastoral priorities. Rent-seeking by government officials has been especially intense in relation to conflicts over pastoral land, environmental management and the fight against desertification. This happened while the international community continued to praise Mali as a model of African democracy.",

First is fragmentation, the dissection of a natural system into spatially isolated parts, which is caused by a number of socioeconomic factors such as changes in land tenure, agriculture, sedentarization, and institutions. Second is climate change and climate variability, which are expected to alter dry and semiarid grasslands now and into the future. Details of these changes are described using examples from Africa and Mongolia. An adaptation framework is used to place global change in context. Although pastoral systems are clearly under numerous constraints and risks have intensified, pastoralists are adapting and trying to remain flexible. It is too early to ask if the responses are enough, given the magnitude and number of changes faced by pastoralists today.",

Although it is often treated as a thing and sometimes as a commodity, it is not like a mat: you cannot roll it up and take it away. To turn it to productive use requires regimes of exclusion that distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses and users, and the inscribing of boundaries through devices such as fences, title deeds, laws, zones, regulations, landmarks and story-lines. Its very ?resourceness? is not an intrinsic or natural quality. It is an assemblage of materialities, relations, technologies and discourses that have to be pulled together and made to align. To render it investible, more work is needed. This Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers Plenary Lecture uses an analytic of assemblage to examine the practices that make up land as a resource. It focuses especially on the ?statistical picturing? devices and other graphic forms that make large-scale investments in land thinkable, and the practices through which relevant actors (experts, investors, villagers, governments) are enrolled. It also considers some of the risks that follow when these large-scale investments land in particular places, as land they must.",

        "abstractNote": "People’s views and values for wild animals are often a result of their experiences and traditional knowledge. Local folklore represents a resource that can enable an understanding of the nature of human-wildlife interactions, especially the underlying cultural values. Using archival searches and semi-structured interviews, we collected narratives about the ibex (Capra sibirica) (n 69), and its predators, the wolf (Canis lupus) (n 52) and the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) (n 43), in Ladakh, India. We compared these stories to those of a mythical carnivore called seng ge or snow lion (n 19), frequently referenced in local Tibetan Buddhist folklore and believed to share many of the traits commonly associated with snow leopards (except for livestock depredation). We then categorized the values along social-cultural, ecological and psychological dimensions. We found that the ibex was predominantly associated with utilitarianism and positive symbolism. Both snow leopard and wolf narratives referenced negative affective and negative symbolic values, though more frequently in the case of wolves. Snow leopard narratives largely focused on utilitarian and ecologistic values. In contrast, snow lion narratives were mostly associated with positive symbolism. Our results suggest that especially for snow leopards and wolves, any potentially positive symbolic associations appeared to be overwhelmed by negative sentiments because of their tendency to prey on livestock, unlike in the case of the snow lion. Since these values reﬂect people’s real and multifarious interactions with wildlife, we recommend paying greater attention to understanding the overlaps between natural and cultural heritage conservation to facilitate human-wildlife coexistence.",

The contributors to this volume examine how things are sold and traded in a variety of social and cultural settings, both present and past. Focusing on culturally defined aspects of exchange and socially regulated processes of circulation, the essays illuminate the ways in which people find value in things and things give value to social relations. By looking at things as if they lead social lives, the authors provide a new way to understand how value is externalized and sought after. Containing contributions from American and British social anthropologists and historians, the volume bridges the disciplines of social history, cultural anthropology, and economics, and marks a major step in our understanding of the cultural basis of economic life and the sociology of culture. It will appeal to anthropologists, social historians, economists, archaeologists, and historians of art.",

Let me explain how they’re connected; and why they can both learn from each other.\n\nBoth bankers and pastoralists must, as a matter of course, work with deep, pervasive uncertainty – where they don’t know the probability of future events. Both often confront ignorance – where they don’t know what they don’t know. These conditions of making important decisions amid incertitude require a very distinct approach to navigating day-to-day practices, as well as long-term futures.\n\nSimple risk management is insufficient, as probabilities of events happening can’t be calculated and outcomes are unknown. Navigating pervasive uncertainty has important consequences, suggesting a particular approach to confronting a turbulent world.",

The progress of knowledge on the sustainability of pastoralism under global environmental change has been notable in the last years. To better characterize this vulnerability, we have examined the existing scientific knowledge about the three dimensions of vulnerability, being exposure illustrated by the existing climate trends and non-climate transformations, sensitivity by the impacts of these on pastoral resources and pastoral land conversions, and adaptation by the adaptation strategies developed by the pastoral communities. A qualitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore patterns and trends across the literature. From this, six different pathways of vulnerability being followed by pastoral communities were identified: Encroachment, Re-greening, Customary, Polarization, Communal and No-alternative. The results point that the livelihood options of pastoralists are generally becoming narrower. Four major forces are identified as exerting determinant influence on the co-production of the vulnerability of pastoralism: (i) the double exposure to climate and non-climate transformations, (ii) the persistence of unfavorable development policies, (iii) the great vitality of adaptation, and (iv) the multifaceted role of markets. We point that it is crucial to distinguish between the component of vulnerability inherent in any economic activity devoted to the use of natural resources, which is the usual business of pastoralism, and the component of vulnerability linked to external forces that disturb the usual working of the pastoral production strategies.",

        "abstractNote": "The Maasai people have acted as the historical stewards of the land and wildlife of the Amboseli Ecosystem for centuries. Maasai culture and its accompanying traditions compose one of the most well-studied anthropological systems in the world. Currently, Maasai culture and tradition face more challenges than ever before. Through a series of interviews with various constituents of the Amboseli community, we sought to discover which traditions the Maasai continued to find important, what were the most formidable threads to those traditions, and how the Maasai were responding to those threats. Community members identified four primary traditions that continue to be important: social connectedness, dress and ornaments, connection with wildlife and nature, and the practice of Moranism. Threats to these traditions include increased the presence of Westerners, tourists, and conservationists; climate change and increased incidence of drought; changing land tenure systems; and the introduction of formal education among younger generations. Maasai community members have responded to these threats by keeping, discarding, or evolving the tradition based on its importance to them. Based on these findings, we detail potential strategies for the maintenance of those traditions which are currently evolving: Moranism and pastoralism. These recommendations will inform Maasai community members about the scope of solutions they currently face, as well as providing insight into more innovative solutions that could be implemented in the future.",

This analysis highlights the vulnerability of agriculture-based livelihood systems to global changes and helps identify what institutions have the potential to mobilize effective relief in different pastoral regions. In terms of results, this vulnerability assessment shows that the vulnerability of pastoralism was very different in all the cases across the globe. As such, a further analysis, based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model was undertaken to enhance our understanding of the ways that global changes put pressures on pastoral livelihoods worldwide. From this we conclude that climate change and climate variability are driving fragile pastoral ecosystems into more vulnerable conditions. Socioeconomic factors, such as changes in land tenure, agriculture, sedentarization, and institutions are fracturing large-scale pastoral ecosystems into spatially isolated systems. The implications of this analysis are that professionals, practitioners, and policy makers should jointly develop a coupled human and natural systems approach that focuses on enhancing the resilience of pastoral communities and their practices. This requires institutional developments to support asset building and good governance to enhance adaptive capability. In addition, pastoralists’ adaptation strategies to global change need to be supported by public awareness and improved by institutional decisions at different scales and dimensions.",

        "abstractNote": "In this paper, we present a history of pastoralism in the ancient Near East from the Neolithic through the Bronze Age. We describe the accretional development of pastoral technologies over eight millennia, including the productive breeding of domestic sheep, goats, and cattle in the early Neolithic and the subsequent domestication of animals used primarily for labor—donkeys, horses, and ﬁnally camels—as well as the ﬁrst appearance of husbandry strategies such as penning, foddering, pasturing, young male culling, and dairy production. Despite frequent references in the literature to prehistoric pastoral nomads, pastoralism in Southwest Asia was strongly associated with sedentary communities that practiced intensive plant cultivation and was largely local in nature. There is very little evidence in prehistoric and early historic Southwest Asia to support the notion of a “dimorphic society” characterized by separate and specialized agriculturists and mobile pastoralists. Although mobile herders were present in the steppe regions of Syria by the early second millennium BC, mobile pastoralism was the exception rather than the rule at that time; its “identiﬁcation” in the archaeological record frequently derives from the application of anachronistic ethnographic analogy. We conclude that pastoralism was a diverse, ﬂexible, and dynamic adaptation in the ancient Near East and call for a reinvigorated and empirically based archaeology of pastoralism in Southwest Asia.",

Despite over a decade of interest and attention generated by this new paradigm, little progress has been achieved on the ground. A major premise of this article is that this impasse results from persistent conceptual difficulties surrounding the relationship between livestock mobility, nonequilibrium ecology, and common property institutions. These difficulties are best resolved through work grounded in the social and ecological realities of particular regions. The promise of such engagements is illustrated through case material from the annual grasslands of Sahelian region of West Africa. The policy implications resulting from a reconceptualization of the relationship between property and dryland ecology are presented.",

This article draws on a growing body of evidence on the emergence of vernacular rural land sales and rental markets to question assumptions that underlie the non-market ' ideal type' communal tenure model that has historically dominated policy thinking in Africa. It argues that recognition of the specific characteristics of 'vernacular land markets'- market-based transfers of land under customary tenure - is essential if state land policies are to succeed in promoting the interests of the poor.",

Yet current discussions around community-driven and decentralized development pay little attention to this nexus, at best reducing power to questions of material difference but overlooking the ways in which governance arrangements are contested. On the basis of research across three sites in Indonesia, this paper explores ways in which tensions between different cultural forms at a village level affect local governance arrangements. The conclusions explore implications for so-called community-driven approaches to development.",

We assessed the role of five pathways through which various correlates potentially influence human responses toward wild animals, namely, value orientation, social interactions (i.e. social cohesion and support), dependence on resources such as agriculture and livestock, risk perception and nature of interaction with the wild animal. We specifically evaluated their influence on people?s responses toward two large carnivores, the snow leopard Panthera uncia and the wolf Canis lupus in an agropastoral landscape in the Indian Trans-Himalaya. We found that the nature of the interaction (location, impact and length of time since an encounter or depredation event), and risk perception (cognitive and affective evaluation of the threat posed by the animal) had a significant influence on attitudes and behaviors toward the snow leopard. For wolves, risk perception and social interactions (the relationship of people with local institutions and inter-community dynamics) were significant. Our findings underscore the importance of interventions that reduce people?s threat perceptions from carnivores, improve their connection with nature and strengthen the conservation capacity of local institutions especially in the context of wolves.",

On the one hand, they are facing various socio-economic and political pressures, including state policies and interventions, population growth, land-use change and integration into a market economy; and on the other hand, they are exposed to climate change and its impacts on their environment and life. The study has been conducted among the Bakarwal tribals of Jammu and Kashmir. The sedentarization of the Bakarwal tribals in Jammu and Kashmir started in the late 20th century and is still going on. In this study 40 Bakarwal households who were formerly nomadic goat and sheep herders, and have now settled down were interviewed in order to document the reasons to settle and the subsequent changes in the lifestyle of these people. All interviewees expressed their satisfaction with their sedentary life. Pasture scarcity, access to education and health services, unstable political atmosphere etc. were given as basic factors for settlement.",

This book examines wide variety of ways in which environmental deterioration, in particular soil erosion, can be viewed and the implicit political judgements that often inform them. Using the context of developing countries, where the effects tend to be more acute due to underdevelopment and climatic factors, this work aims to examine this source of uncertainty and make explicit the underlying assumptions in the debate about soil erosion. It also rejects the notion that soil erosion is a politically neutral issue and argues that conservation requires fundamental social change. This title will be of interest to students of environmental and developmental studies.",

        "abstractNote": "Historical papers relating to water often focus on a physical structure or archaeological artefact that is being investigated in order to achieve insight into the life, times or understanding of a historical culture or people. In this sense, the current paper is an anomaly in that the “artefact” motivating this historical review of the hydrological cycle was observed first in the classroom. More specifically, many years of teaching hydrology has highlighted the difficulty students often have in achieving a broad and deep understanding of hydrological processes. Several reasons could be proposed for the observed pedagogical difficulties, but what is of interest here is that a student's struggles are reminiscent of the historical ones relating to first deducing the hydrological cycle. Thus, a novel hypothesis is tentatively advanced: concepts that were tortuous or taxing to deduce historically often, and for quite similar reasons, are challenging to teach, and vice versa. While a comprehensive psychological exploration of this observation is beyond the scope of this article, a few broader connections are briefly explored.",

For all the countries covered here, it is difficult to disaggregate at the national level the economic outputs of pastoral livestock from livestock more generally. Research studies have nonetheless identified the distinctive contributions of pastoralism and occasionally quantified these contributions for selected localities and regions. This work demonstrates that the economic role of pastoralism can be quite different even for national economies in the same region. There also exist broad regional differences between the Horn, where pastoralists are heavily involved in producing live animals for export, and southern Africa, where smaller herds are kept primarily for purposes other than commercial sales. At least three methodological shortcomings limit our ability to quantify the contributions made by pastoralists to national economies: aggregated national statistics, the selective recording of data on pastoral production, and analytical confusion about how to impute realistic cash values to the products that herders obtain from their own herds for their own consumption.",

        "abstractNote": "Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources. Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it removes important technologies for coping with high variability in rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute rangelands.",

Although exclusions engendered by inter-community boundary conﬂicts usually aﬀect large numbers of people, empirical research has mostly focused on largescale land grabbing. Drawing on three intercommunity land boundary conﬂicts in the Upper West Region (UWR) using in-depth interviews, this paper examines the underlying drivers, the exclusion and counter-exclusion strategies deployed by disputing groups and makes policy recommendations for resolving the customary land boundary dilemma. We ﬁnd that the undocumented nature of inter-community land boundaries and tenure histories; weakening of the traditional land tenure system; rising land value and widespread land leasing; and statutory interference are key underling drivers of ethno-territorial land boundary conﬂicts. These drivers have created incentives and maneuvering spaces for competing communities/clans to deploy varied interpretations of the ‘past’ and ‘space’ in particular combinations that serve their interests to control more land. Although the traditional land dispute resolution system is eﬀective in resolving boundary conﬂicts, disputing groups are increasingly turning to the courts for redress. However, with the lack of written tenure history, the judicial process is marred by uncertainty, which in turn opens the courts to delays and corruption. While land reform has been widely proposed for resolving the customary land dilemma in most countries in SSA including Ghana, we argue that these reforms will be meaningless unless existing boundary disputes are eﬀectively resolved. We recommend inter-community boundary reconciliation as an initial step. Through this program, a customary land boundary information system can be established to circumvent future tenure ambiguities.",

This paper investigates recent ideas on the interaction of pastoralism and conservation that question the validity of the concepts of overstocking and overgrazing as applied to arid and semi-arid rangelands. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a Maasai pastoralist/wildlife conservation joint land use area in northern Tanzania, shows no clear signs of pastoralist-induced environmental degradation despite a preoccupation with this possibility by successive administrations. Ecological studies together with other considerations suggest that joint land use works to the long-term benefit of both pastoralism and conservation in this and other areas.]",

Although the process began with colonialism, pastoralism is currently witnessing a crisis in postcolonial India as the consequence of a progressively sedentarising state, intensification of commercialised agriculture and urbanisation. The Gujars of Rajasthan have made claims for recognition demanding scheduled tribe (ST) status to counter inequality. Clearly, this inequality has been historically constituted. Hence, the play of inequality and resistance is addressed through an examination of two clusters of events around the years 2007 and 1857. Currently, the state defines tribes in terms of indices that have been subject to neither review nor public debate. It is not only the vision of the state that is compromised by colonial anthropology and history, but also that of civil society and community. Tragically, communities are forced to format their histories in terms of an archaic indigeneity. Further, claims to social justice and equality are reduced to demands for quotas rather than addressing critically and creatively the violence of development and knowledge. Thus, the politico-administrative category, ST, itself becomes a mode of violence, pointing to the need to debate afresh the grounds on which tribality is constituted.",

Population growth; loss of herding lands to private farms, ranches, game parks, and urban areas; increased commoditization of the livestock economy; out-migration by poor pastoralists; and periodic dislocations brought about by drought, famine, and civil war are increasing in pastoralist regions of the world. Mongolia and China, however, have seen a revitalization of pastoral production with decollectivization. This review examines problems of pastoral governance and development including the ?tragedy of the commons? debate, threats to common property rights, the effects of commercial ranching on pastoral economies, decollectivization in the former socialist countries, and the current state of development policies of Western donor countries. Case examples from the Maasai and Barabaig of East Africa and pastoralists of Mongolia and China illustrate these changes.",

The other compares political strategies and the influence of traditional chiefs in Ghana and South Africa.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines innovations in livestock marketing that livestock traders in northern Kenya use to overcome a host of trading obstacles. Livestock trading in northern Kenya is one of the toughest and most risk-prone jobs in the region, yet livestock traders have been able not only to transform the ways in which trading is conducted through ‘home-made’ innovations, but also to mitigate trading risks. The article demonstrates how livestock traders have become resilient to risks and have been able to succeed in a trade that in the past many have had to abandon. Trust embedded in social networks and relations reinforces the adoption of risk-minimizing strategies. The article focuses on the broad field of pastoral risk management to illustrate how an innovative risk management strategy can be used to create a successful business entrepreneurship in a risk-prone environment. I draw on fieldwork conducted during 2001–2 among cattle traders in Moyale District of northern Kenya and Nairobi, and on recent work among Somali livestock traders-cum-ranchers in Garissa District of North Eastern and Coast provinces.\n          , \n            Cet article examine les innovations en matière de commercialisation du bétail que les négociants en bétail du Nord du Kenya utilisent pour surmonter une multitude d'obstacles aux échanges. Bien que le commerce du bétail dans le Nord du Kenya soit l'une des activités les plus dures et les plus risquées de la région, les négociants en bétail ont réussi à non seulement transformer les modes d'échange par le biais d'innovations « de fabrication maison », mais également à réduire les risques commerciaux. L'article montre comment les négociants en bétail ont développé une résistance aux risques et ont réussi dans un secteur que beaucoup ont dû abandonner par le passé. La confiance qui fait partie intégrante des réseaux sociaux et des relations renforce l'adoption de stratégies de minimisation des risques. L'article examine le domaine assez large de la gestion du risque pastoral pour illustrer l'utilisation d'une stratégie innovante de gestion du risque pour créer une entreprise commerciale prospère dans un environnement à risque. L'auteur s'appuie sur des travaux de terrain menés en 2001–2002 auprès de négociants en bétail du district de Moyale dans le Nord du Kenya et à Nairobi, et sur des travaux récents menés auprès de négociants-éleveurs somaliens du district de Garissa des provinces côtières et du Nord-Est.",

        "abstractNote": "Although coexistence with wildlife is a key goal of conservation, little is known about it or how to study it. By coexistence we mean a sustainable though dynamic state in which humans and wildlife coadapt to sharing landscapes, where human interactions with wildlife are effectively governed to ensure wildlife populations persist in socially legitimate ways that ensure tolerable risk levels. Problems that arise from current conflictoriented framing of human–wildlife interactions include reinforcing a human–nature dichotomy as fundamentally oppositional, suggesting coexistence requires the absence of conflict, and skewing research and management toward direct negative impacts over indirect impacts and positive aspects of living with wildlife. Human behavior toward wildlife is framed as rational calculus of costs and benefits, sidelining emotional and cultural dimensions of these interactions. Coexistence is less studied due to unfamiliarity with relevant methodologies, including qualitative methods, self-reflexivity and ethical rigor, and constraints on funding and time. These challenges are illustrated with examples from fieldwork in India and Africa. We recommend a basic approach to case studies aimed at expanding the scope of inquiries into human–wildlife relations beyond studies of rational behavior and quantification of costs and benefits of wildlife to humans.",

Contrary to primordialist and environmental conflict theories of pastoralist violence, we shed light on the changing political rationality of inter-group conflicts by retracing the multiple impacts of state-building on pastoral land tenure and resource governance, peacemaking and custommary authorities, and competition over state resources. Based on an extensive comparative review of recent case studies, post-1991 administrative decentralisation is identified as a major driving force in struggles for resources between transhumant herders in Ethiopia’s peripheral regions. Our analysis emphasises the politicisation of kinship relations and group identities and the transformation of conflict motives under the influence of the gradual incorporation of (agro-)pastoral groups into the Ethiopian nation-state. Ethnic federalism incites pastoralists to engage in parochial types of claim-making, to occupy territory on a more permanent basis and to become involved in ‘politics of difference’ with neighbouring groups.",

Contributors show that despite differences in landscape, environment, and administrative and political structures, these societies share a major characteristic-high flexibility. Based partially on the adaptability of various domestic animals to difficult environments and partially on the ability of people to establish networks allowing them to accommodate political, social, and economic needs, this flexibility is key to the survival of complex pastoral systems and serves as the connection among the varied cultures in the volume.In<em>The Ecology of Pastoralism</em>, a variety of case studies from a broad geographic sampling uses archaeological and contemporary data and offers a new perspective on the study of pastoralism, making this volume a valuable contribution to current research in the area.",

This paper suggests that policies directed at improving livestock governance in a context of climate change and changes in land cover and land tenure need to focus on securing pastoralists’ reticular territories, which are made up of corridors and numerous areas of pastureland, rather than on creating disconnected state ranches.",

This essay explores the progression of theoretical models and empirical research linked to the understanding of the capacity of forested systems to regulate the hydrological regimes of a given area. Drawing upon writings of American and Indian foresters, I suggest that a diversity of viewpoints with regard to the climatic and protective capabilities of forests, expressed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries gradually gave way to a more unified – and highly alarmist – ‘desiccationist’ discourse by the middle of the 20th century. This position has been sustained within much of the popular press as well as in the publications of numerous conservation agencies, despite being based on models of forest functioning discredited in the ecological literature since the 1920s. This essay documents this transformation, and explores some of the factors that may have helped in the production of this powerful and lasting discourse on degradation.",

India’s livestock sector is one of the largest in\nthe world with a holding of 11.6% of world livestock population. Contribution of livestock\nand fisheries sectors to the national economy in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is\n4.1 and 0.8%, respectively. Agriculture and allied sector contributed about 15.1% to the total\nGDP. Out of the total agricultural GDP, livestock sector contributed about 27.25% during\n2012-13. The livestock sector is an important source of foreign exchange too and is\nperforming well in the manner of production, value addition and export of dairy, fishery,\nwool, poultry and other products.",

        "abstractNote": "Reﬂecting on the shifting landscape of higher education, this discussion highlights how inequality is entrenched within the university, largely as a result of Western-inspired, commodiﬁed knowledge production processes. The article grapples with scholarship on cognitive justice and builds a case for transformative resistance that is simultaneously anti-colonial and anti-neoliberal, within, against and beyond the Westernised university. The discussion concentrates speciﬁcally on epistemic hegemonies and internationalisation, and argues that substantive decolonisation as a counterhegemonic project must entail an intellectual element that is aimed at transforming the knowledge structures that facilitate dehumanisation. The pursuit of more equitable, antiracist futures must thus involve the identiﬁcation and obliteration of deeply embedded epistemic hegemonies, which have been created through the dehumanising processes of capital expansion and colonisation. This article oﬀers a hopeful approach that encourages the collaborative creation of a counter-university that actively pursues epistemic diversity as a pathway to alternative futures.",

This paper uses a comparative empirical approach to show how central governments in six countries—Senegal, Uganda, Nepal, Indonesia, Bolivia, and Nicaragua—use a variety of strategies to obstruct the democratic decentralization of resource management and, hence, retain central control. Eﬀective decentralization requires the construction of accountable institutions at all levels of government and a secure domain of autonomous decision making at the local level.",

That has not, of course, settled all the controversy regarding the nature and the content of the Right to Development, but the inter-governmental debate has shifted more to the methods of implementation of that Right. This article reviews the nature and contents of the Right to Development by virtue of which every individual is entitled to a process of economic, social, cultural and political development in which all human and fundamental freedoms can be realized. It spells out a programme for implementation of the Right, step by step, through national efforts supported by international co-operation. While the states are primarily responsible for realizing this Right for their citizens, the international community has the obligation of enabling the states to do so. A mechanism is proposed through international compacts to design, promote and monitor the process of implementation.",

Through an empirical case study from Pelgon county, Tibet Autonomous Region in China, this paper provides an empirical analysis of rangeland use rights privatisation. It shows that the tragedy of the commons is not the correct model to apply to Tibetan pastoralism because pasture use in Tibet has never been an open-access institution. Thus, when the tragedy of the commons model is applied as a rationale for rangeland use rights privatisation, the result is not what is intended by the policy, but rather a misfit to features of pastoralism and thus disruption of the essence of pastoralism, i.e. mobility and flexibility. The paper further shows that a hybrid institution combining household rangeland tenure with community-based use with user fees is a restoration of the pastoralist institution. This demonstrates the capacity of pastoralists to create adaptive new institutions congruent with the interdependent and integrated nature of pastoralism consisting of three components: pastoralists, livestock, and rangeland.",

Despite its clear potential to tackle the dryland dynamics, the tradition of pastoralism in Kutch has been systematically denigrated and marginalised in the district over the years. Drawing on research conducted in eastern Kutch, and along the coast, this article shows how pastoralist communities have been displaced from a range of vital hydric resources – such as mangroves and water sources – in the name of development and conservation. Together, these have accelerated processes of dispossession and exacerbated both ‘old’ and ‘new’ resource scarcities.",

The state encouraged and thrived upon this combination of diverse activities. This situation was profoundly transformed by the establishment of the colonial rule. New notions of property and rights of land use were imposed. The traditional claims to pastures and forest resources by the village communities were questioned. Colonial land revenue and forest regulations marginalized the pastoralists and shifted the balance towards agriculture. In independent India, too, local communities have been ignored and the state continues to exercise virtually exclusive control over forest resources.",

On a global scale, new patterns of resource exploration, extraction, and commodiﬁcation create new territories. This takes place within a dynamic of frontiers and territorialization. Frontier dynamics dissolve existing social orders—property systems, political jurisdictions, rights, and social contracts—whereas territorialization is shorthand for all the dynamics that establish them and re-order space anew. Frontier moments oﬀer new opportunities, and old social contracts give way to struggles over new ones. As new types of resource commodiﬁcation emerge, institutional orders are sometimes undermined or erased, and sometimes reinterpreted, reinvented, and recycled. New property regimes, new forms of authority, and the attendant struggles for legitimacy over the ability to deﬁne proper uses and users follow frontier moments. The drawing of borders and the creation of orders around new resources profoundly rework patterns of authority and institutional architectures. We argue that the territorialization of resource control is a set of processes that precedes legitimacy and authority, fundamentally challenging and replacing existing patterns of spatial control, authority, and institutional orders. It is dynamics of this sort that the articles in this collection explore: the outcomes produced in the frontier space, the kinds of authority that emerge through control over space and the people in it, and the battles for legitimacy that this entails. This collection explores the emergence of frontier spaces, arguing that these are transitional, liminal spaces in which existing regimes of resource control are suspended, making way for new ones.",

Methodologically, the genre of memoir affords a rich source portraying the everyday social fabric of rural Gujarat in the 1970s and the changing landscape of the state in later years. In the course of essaying her life stories, she depicts the predicaments and contestations about ‘place’, ‘mobility’ and social interactions within the larger matrix of Gujarati society. What is depicted in graphic detail is the transformation in the web of social relations at the margins of Gujarati society and the present ‘crisis of faith’ that underlies its civil society.",

The authors come from a variety of academic disciplines including anthropology, geography, political science, and development studies, but each raises issues of geographic significance. These case examples range across a continuum of pastoral-state relationships into several distinct types. The first set of articles illustrates the situation of marginalized pastoralists dealing with dominant state structures, illustrated by the articles from India and Israel. The second set illustrates complex cases of weakened states with independent pastoral activity, including Somalia and Mongolia. A third set describes weak states dealing with marginalized pastoral groups, those in Cameroon, Kenya and Somalia.",

The case of the \"sugar frontier\" demonstrates that early modern capitalism was both highly \"industrial\" and profoundly destructive of the natural environment. The ecological devastation caused by sugar cultivation and processing, in combination with booming European demand, was a major force behind the geographic expansion of the world-economy in the early modern period. The article shows the interconnections between the sugar frontier, the world-economy, and such socioecological issues as: deforestation, soil erosion, livestock overpopulation, delocalization of food supply, hydraulic systems, worker health and safety, monocultures, species extinction, and climate change.",

This paper makes a novel contribution to these discussions by highlighting the contradictory effects of territory and property in indigenous land claims processes. My analysis departs from a consideration of multicultural cartographies of territorially-bounded indigeneity and their awkward articulation with the racial regimes of ownership (Bhandar, 2018) that undergird settler and postcolonial property systems. The paper then examines how this tension has played out in the mapping and titling of Native Community Lands in South-eastern Bolivia. I trace how the discursive and cartographic representation of Native Community Lands as bounded, contiguous spaces of indigeneity has been undermined by the socio-spatial effects of propertisation, which has reinscribed colonial hierarchies of race and property, leaving indigenous villages isolated within discontinuous fragments of marginal land. The paper concludes by examining how the tensions between territory and property continue to haunt indigenous resource politics in the Bolivian Chaco two decades after the creation of Native Community Lands.",

In many pastoral settings, rangelands are undergoing processes of fragmentation due to tenure transformations, as previously communal lands are privatized into individual holdings. Such processes of enclosure have raised concerns over the long-term costs on pastoral communities and on rangeland eco-systems. This paper explores pastoral responses and adaptations to enclosure based on long-term ethnographic engagement in a Maasai community in Southern Kenya that has recently privatized. Detailed family case studies and herd tracking illuminate the ways in which families try to re-create the commons by relying on social networks for free access to resources. In particular, women’s social networks (for example, their kin, affines, friends, or religious associates) seem to play an important role. This paper calls attention to the need to better understand women’s changing roles in pastoral governance and production and the implications these new roles have for women’s well-being and for pastoralism in the face of fragmentation.",

The most commonly spoken about populations in this context are the seasonal movement of labour from eastern India (Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa) to sink states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra (primarily Mumbai), Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. There is, however, an entirely different kind of migratory community that has simply not featured in these discussions, viz, the nomadic pastoralist communities present in many parts of the country.\nPastoralists depend on the seasonality of forage that is available in certain landscapes in order to feed their large herds of animals. Arid and semi-arid grasslands of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the Deccan Plateau are unfit for agriculture, but have a seasonal flush of high-nutrition forage during and after the monsoon. Similarly, high altitude pastures across the Himalayan ranges, snow-bound during the winters, offer remarkably high-quality forage during the summer and monsoon. Pastoralists move seasonally into and out of these areas for four to five months, and the remainder of the year through forests and amongst cultivating communities that welcome them for the high- quality fertilizer made possible by their large herds of animals.",

Today they are rapidly sedentarizing and in many areas suitable for farming, they are adopting rain-fed agriculture. As a result of these dynamics, claims to individual property on de facto communal rangelands have arisen, and to such an extent that they seriously threaten the peace of the community. This article explores the conﬂicts that emerge in the transition from common property to private tenure. Using locally prominent land disputes as exemplary cases, it focuses on the role of traditional gerontocratic authorities in the attempt to resolve a growing number of land disputes; on the emerging power of patrilineal clans and local elites in the enforcement of access to land; and on the incompetence of government agencies to intervene. The failure of customary institutions to ensure land tenure security leads to a situation in which women and marginalized actors in particular are threatened with displacement, and in which most local actors want the state to intervene and establish formal property rights.",

Thirteen articles are introduced around six themes that have characterised IDS-linked research over this period. These are: pastoral livelihoods; institutions and common property resource management; climate change and ecological dynamics; food security, early warning, and livelihood vulnerability; pastoral marketing; and conflict and governance.\nAcross these themes, IDS research has challenged mainstream development thinking and practice, highlighting the importance of mobility and living with uncertainty. This introductory article concludes with some reflections on research gaps and new challenges, including: the effects of climate change; new forms of pastoral mobility and livelihood; increasing pattern of commoditisation and social differentiation; and changing conflict dynamics. Although massively changed over 50 years, and despite repeated proclamations of crisis and collapse, pastoralism remains, we argue, an important, resilient source of livelihood in marginal rangeland areas across the world, from which others can learn.",

        "abstractNote": "Over the past few years, “Sustainable Development” (SD) has emerged as the latest development catchphrase. A wide range of nongovernmental as well as governmental organizations have embraced it as the new paradigm of development. A review of the literature that has sprung up around the concept of SD indicates, however, a lack of consistency in its interpretation. More important, while the all-encompassing nature of the concept gives it political strength, its current formulation by the mainstream of SD thinking contains significant weaknesses. These include an incomplete perception of the problems of poverty and environmental degradation, and confusion about the role of economic growth and about the concepts of sustainability and participation. How these weaknesses can lead to inadequacies and contradictions in policy making is demonstrated in the context of international trade, agriculture, and forestry. It is suggested that if SD is to have a fundamental impact, politically expedient fuzziness will have to be given up in favor of intellectual clarity and rigor.",

        "abstractNote": "Although India's cooperative dairying program is lauded as a model of successful rural development, lack of uniformity in replication of the program across rural India has raised questions about the meanings of success. Differences between dairy cooperatives become especially apparent when crossbred cows are considered, so that the promotion of crossbreds by dairy development agencies has not always resulted in their actual adoption by farmers. This article seeks to explain the mixed reception accorded to crossbred cows by focusing on the link between development and place. By discussing both official discourses and local perspectives, the article enables two kinds of understanding of dairy development. First, the rise and fall of support for crossbred cows within India's national plans suggest that contrasts between official policies and local practices of dairying need to be attentive to the dynamics of both discourses and places. Second, the comparison between two villages?one utilizing crossbred cows and the other water buffaloes as principal dairy animals?shows that evaluations of success or failure cannot be made simply on the basis of adoption or rejection of crossbred cows but requires engagement with place-specific agricultural economies and social relations. Given the liberalization of India's dairy sector, official discourses and material experiences of cooperative dairying become significant for ascertaining future possibilities for small-scale farming and equitable economic growth in rural India.",

        "abstractNote": "The savannahs of Asia remain locally unrecognized as distinctive ecosystems, and continue to be viewed as degraded forests or seasonally dry tropical forests. These colonial-era legacies are problematic, because they fail to recognize the unique diversity of Asian savannahs and the critical roles of fire and herbivory in maintaining ecosystem health and diversity. In this review, we show that: the palaeo-historical evidence suggests that the savannahs of Asia have existed for at least 1 million years, long before widespread landscape modification by humans; savannah regions across Asia have levels of C\n              4\n              grass endemism and diversity that are consistent with area-based expectations for non-Asian savannahs; there are at least three distinct Asian savannah communities, namely deciduous broadleaf savannahs, deciduous fine-leafed and spiny savannahs and evergreen pine savannahs, with distinct functional ecologies consistent with fire- and herbivory-driven community assembly. Via an analysis of savannah climate domains on other continents, we map the potential extent of savannahs across Asia. We find that the climates of African savannahs provide the closest analogues for those of Asian deciduous savannahs, but that Asian pine savannahs occur in climates different to any of the savannahs in the southern continents. Finally, we review major threats to the persistence of savannahs in Asia, including the mismanagement of fire and herbivory, alien woody encroachment, afforestation policies and future climate uncertainty associated with the changing Asian monsoon. Research agendas that target these issues are urgently needed to manage and conserve these ecosystems.\n            \n            This article is part of the themed issue ‘Tropical grassy biomes: linking ecology, human use and conservation’.",

        "abstractNote": "Highly populated tropical countries face tremendous pressures in reconciling the needs for improved economic security and the protection of declining biodiversity. India is no exception and its biodiversity is under severe pressure due to complex interactions among land use change, other human economic activities, and climate change. Preservation and restoration of biodiversity is perhaps the cheapest and least risky way to mitigate the impacts of threats such as climate change, diminishing food and nutritional security, declining economy, absence of affordable healthcare, rising zoonotic diseases and lack of capacity to address these issues. Here we describe a framework for biodiversity conservation – the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-Being (NMBHWB) for India – which integrates biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate change, agriculture, health, bio-economy and capacity building in the realm of biodiversity science. We provide an overview of the seven Programs of the Mission which make it interdisciplinary, integrative, and comprehensive in its approach. The Mission explicitly links research with policy-making and implementation for effective management of biodi­ versity with sustainable development. With its emphasis on convergence and synergies among various goals, themes and project sites, the Mission will further develop new models for stakeholder consultations and coproduction of knowledge. We posit that the NMBHWB will enable India to realize the United Nations Sustain­ able Development Goals and Targets while advancing India’s commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change and other international environmental conventions and treaties.",

Drawing on interviews, ethnography and archives of industrial development agencies, it compares earlier steel towns and state-run industrial estates with today’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and argues that they embody different regimes of dispossession. While steel towns and industrial estates reﬂected a regime of land for production with pretensions of inclusive social transformation, SEZs represent a neoliberal regime of land for the market in which ‘land broker states’ have emerged to indiscriminately transfer land from peasants to capitalist ﬁrms for real estate. The present regime has been unable to achieve the ideological legitimacy of its predecessor, leading to more widespread and successful ‘land wars’. The article argues more broadly that variations in dispossession across space and time can be understood as speciﬁc constellations of state roles, economic logics tied to class interests and ideological articulations of the ‘public good’.",

Although a large and apparently growing number of political ecologists engage the concept of biopower directly – in its Foucauldian, Agambenian, and various other formulations – recent writings across the humanities and social sciences by scholars utilizing an explicitly biopolitical lens provide us with an array of concepts and research questions that may further enrich writings within political ecology. Seeking to extend dialogue between scholars of biopolitics, of political ecology, and of both, then, this article surveys both new and shifting contours of the various ways in which contemporary political ecologies increasingly compel us to bring the very lives of various human and nonhuman populations, as Foucault once put it, \"into the realm of explicit calculations.\" In doing so, 'new frontiers' of biopolitical inquiry are examined related to: i) species, varieties, or 'multiple modes' of governmentality and biopower; ii) critical (ecosystem) infrastructure, risk, and 'reflexive' biopolitics; iii) environmental history, colonialism, and the genealogies of biopower, and iv) the proliferation of related neologisms, such as ontopower and geontopower.",

Decline of pasturage and capitalisation of agricultural production regimes have long been identified as culprits in 'squeezing' the region's livestock producers out of the\n economy (Salzman 1986). Reports of the death of Rajasthani pastoralism, however, have been greatly exaggerated; livestock production in the region continues to boom and animal production remains closely tied to the increasingly capitalised agricultural system of the area. Indeed, the expansion\n of the agricultural economy, which has had a squeezing effect on pastoralism, has itself been enabled by the growth of the livestock economy. This contradiction, whereby pastoralism continues to grow 'inwards' towards the centre of the regional economy, even while it is increasingly pushed\n 'outwards' to its margins, marks an odd disparity in economic development.",

Through strategic mobility, pastoralism finds an asset in the existence of dynamic variability in the drylands, where sedentary agriculture or mixed farming find a problem in their lack of uniformity and stability.It is crucial to distinguish between the vulnerability that is the business of pastoral systems to manage and the vulnerability that arises from obstacles to operate the system.Unless investments are shifted from replacing pastoralism to developing pastoralism on its own terms, we risk jeopardizing food security well beyond the limits of the drylands, and we risk missing pastoralism's important lesson on turning environmental instability into an asset for food production.",

Three historical phases in this relationship are hypothesized, name(y a Colonial phase, a Developmentalist phase and an Environmentalist phase. While each of these was characterized by distinct and even contradictory ideological orientations, in practice they merely provided diffirent reasons for pursuing antipastoral policies. This paper focuses on the Developmentalist phase of this relationship. It is argued that the mechanics and ideology of development played a critical role in alienating pastoralists and sought to deprive them of a legitimate means of livelihood. However once we recognize that the discomfort between state and shepherd is a historical rather than an inherent antipathy, we take an important step in working towards negotiated solutions. It is nonetheless worrying that in the guise of environmentalism, state-shepherd relations do seem headed for yet another round of confrontation.",

The economy of the early pastoral societies of this part of the subcontinent was based on transforming the region's natural thorn forest into an anthropogenic savanna. During the succeeding millennia, as the result of intensification of land-use patterns in response to demographic and political pressures, the culturally desirable jangala \"savanna\" became transformed into the culturally undesirable jangal \"forest waste.\" This transformation in both physical environment and cultural values was the product of a dialectical relationship between nature and culture.

While focusing on Punjab, this path breaking analysis offers a broad argument about the workings of colonial power: the fantasy of imperialism, it says, is to make the universe afresh. Such radical change, Bhattacharya shows, is as much conceptual as material. Agrarian colonization was a process of creating spaces that conformed to the demands of colonial rule. It entailed establishing a regime of categories--tenancies, tenures, properties, habitations--and a framework of laws that made the change possible. Agrarian colonization was in this sense a deep conquest. Colonialism, the book suggests, has the power to revisualize and reorder social relations and bonds of community. It alters the world radically, even when it seeks to preserve elements of the old. The changes it brings about are simultaneously cultural, discursive, legal, linguistic, spatial, social, and economic. Moving from intent to action, concepts to practices, legal enactments to court battles, official discourses to folklore, this book explores the conflicted and dialogic nature of a transformative process. By analyzing this great conquest, and the often-silent ways in which it unfolds, the book asks every historian to rethink the practice of writing agrarian history and reflect on the larger issues of doing history\"--",

        "abstractNote": "Since the privatization of livestock in 1992, rates of absentee ownership of livestock have increased sharply in Mongolia. Unlike other documented instances of absentee herding in pastoral societies, absentee herd ownership has few detrimental ecological or social impacts in Mongolia. Rather, the relationship between absentee herd owners and herders may be viewed as a revitalized institution, with links to customary patterns of urban-rural exchange, emerging to meet the needs of both herders and town-dwellers during the transition from a socialist planned economy to a free market economy. Absentee herding in Mongolia differs from absentee and contract herding accounts from Africa and the Middle East in its continuing emphasis on subsistence rather than speculative investment and accumulation. Other important distinctions include: (1) absentee owners and herders are usually kin or friends; (2) herders tend their own private herds in addition to absenteeowned animals;(3)few ethnic, caste, or class differences existbetween herders and absentee herd owners; and (4) herders from all wealth strata tend absentee-owned animals. Policies to restrict or regulate absentee livestock ownership must be carefully considered in the Mongolian context, making clear distinctions between informal, mutually beneficial subsistence-driven arrangements among kin and friends, and more formal investment-driven contracts between businesses or investors and herders.",

This article argues that, despite contrasting research traditions and conceptual framings, there are many commonalities. The classic problematics of agrarian studies – around production, accumulation and politics –apply as much to pastoralists as they do to peasants. Processes of social diﬀerentiation and class formation, the role of wage labour and questions around mobilisation and politics are consistently relevant. However, a reﬂection on a large literature on pastoralism across nine world regions reveals that there are nevertheless some important contrasts with classic representations of a settled peasantry. These are: living with and oﬀ uncertainty; mobility to respond to variability; ﬂexible land control and new forms of tenure; dynamic social formations; collective social relations for a new moral economy; engaging with complex markets and a new politics for a transforming world. The article concludes by arguing that, under contemporary conditions, these are all important for understanding settled agrarian systems too, as today pastoralists and peasants face many of the same challenges. These seven themes, the article argues, oﬀer a new set of lenses for examining pastoral and peasant settings alike, helping to expand perspectives in agrarian studies.",

It has been shown that increase in livestock numbers may adversely affect wildlife populations associated with high altitude pastures. In this study, we examine the decadal trend in livestock numbers and composition in five villages in Spiti in the Trans-Himalaya region to determine social-ecological linkages in these agropastoral communities. As opposed to previously reported trends, we find that livestock numbers have essentially halved in the last decade and the reduced holdings also are compositionally different from the original stock. We examine the societal, agricultural and perceived ecological changes associated with the decline in livestock. We conclude that the decline in livestock is associated with large-scale changes in the social, cultural and economic landscape and that this decline may benefit wildlife conservation programmes in the region.",

Here simple animal production models establish the occurrence of overstocking in a traditional agropastoral system in the Spiti Valley of the Indian Trans-Himalaya. Empirical data show that fecundity of adult female livestock is related to total livestock biomass density (S) as a negative linear function of S. Total herd production is modelled as a quadratic function of S, thereby calculating an optimum livestock biomass density (Sop), at which total herd production is maximized. A sample of 40 villages showed that over 83% of Spiti’s rangelands may be overstocked with values of S Ͼ Sop. Overstocking seems to be a classic case of the tragedy of the commons, as livestock is individually owned while the land is communally grazed. Recent socio-economic changes have probably contributed to high levels of overstocking. Even areas within wildlife reserves are overstocked. Conservation management needs to focus on creation of grazing free areas and management of livestock densities.",

It uses a neo-institutional perspective to show how control over information is crucial if shepherds are to prevent their leader from misusing the extensive powers he possesses to make decisions on their behalf. Control over information is not, however, sufficient. The paper argues that shepherds must also possess the capacity to impose sanctions if their leader oversteps the bounds of delegated decision-making authority. The paper highlights the importance of politics and the divergent interests of the shepherds and their leaders. In so doing, it allows inquiry into a system of social interactions that is characterized by conflicting interests and the negotiation of conflict, but is often perceived as harmonious. At the same time, the investigation offers new insights into other social situations structured by principal-agent relationships.]",

This stance can be traced to a long-established approach in the disciplines that inform pastoral development planning (natural resource management, range ecology, animal science) to rely on analytical tools based on standard statistics and average values. However, pastoralism is better understood as a sui generis production system, that deliberately exploits the transient concentrations of nutrients that represent the most reliable feature of dryland environments; a system geared at maximising the production of economic value while stabilising its performance in environments where ‘uncertainty’ is harnessed for production. As average values and standard statistics fail to capture non-uniform distribution (relied upon for production in dryland pastoralism), they should not uniquely or uncritically inform pastoral development planning.",

        "abstractNote": "Pastoral and agro-pastoral areas in eastern Africa and elsewhere on the continent have long been regarded as peripheries, especially in economic terms, but also in terms of social and cultural accomplishments. Although biased perceptions of the ‘unproductive’ uses of pastoralism have become outdated, government policies still do little to formally recognise or integrate pastoral lands as critical parts of rural livelihood systems and economic development models. Instead, many states give preference to large-scale agricultural investments in pastoral areas, resulting in the loss or fragmentation of rangelands, induced sedentarisation of pastoralists, and a radical reduction in livestock numbers. The Lands of the Future Research Network supports the view that alienation of pastoralists from productive lands often is unwarranted, unproductive, and unadvisable. In such cases it would be better for the overall economy and society to leave things as they are, or, if ‘development’ comes in, to discuss the development potential of pastoralism. In other cases of integrated economies, combining old and new forms (‘mixed agriculture’ on a societal scale) might offer advantages to all groups of participants as well as the national economy. Drawing on research from Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Tanzania our paper looks at the significance of pastoralism as a productive economy and the positive bearing it has on the environment, wildlife conservation, and on the health and well-being of pastoral communities. The paper also reflects on what is at stake when one form of land use is replaced by another and when customary rules and practices regarding land access, land use, and traditional law are not fully recognised by policy makers. Using historical examples (e.g. from Afar) and current development trends (e.g. Ethiopia’s river basin development in the Omo Valley), the paper shows how the impacts of such development need not be negative (e.g. forced displacement, resettlement, conflict). The authors urge development planners and governments to integrate the expertise of agro-pastoralists into development models and to establish strong relationships between investors, NGOs, GOs, policy makers, researchers, local communities, and other stakeholders in order to find equitable and longterm solutions for changing land uses.",

It is premised on assumptions that fail to recognise the socially embedded character of land transfers. Agrarian political economy oﬀers an understanding of the processes surrounding land transfers that emphasises social embeddedness. As a consequence of the speciﬁc characteristics of neoliberal enclosure market imperatives are now used to deepen capitalist social property relations in the South. Neoliberal enclosure is in turn facilitating the reconﬁguration of a ‘bifurcated’ agrarian structure in which emergent exportoriented capitalist farming sits alongside peasant subsistence-oriented farming. This is part of an ongoing process of expanded commodiﬁcation of both rural products and rural labour, the latter of which is seen in widespread semiproletarianisation.",

The ubiquity of mobile phones in rural livestock communities is thought to “transform” or “revolutionize” the way different social groups interact as they manage social, political and environmental challenges to their livelihood strategies. This research among pastoralists in Kenya examines the political, economic, ecological and socio-spatial contexts in which mobile phones are used and places these contexts within pre-existing resource struggles in order to understand the prevalence of mobile phone use among pastoralists. Results indicate that, while the use of mobile phones for herding is widespread, the extent and efficacy of information sharing is strongly influenced by pre-existing social struggles to gain access to prohibited grazing locations.",

Speciﬁcally it focuses on the case of the nomadic Gaddi shepherds and ofﬁcial attempts to regulate their access to grazing pastures in the Indian Himalayas. It is often predicted that the increased presence of the modern state critically undermines locally appropriate and community-based resource management arrangements. Drawing on the work of Pauline Peters and Francis Cleaver, I identify key instances of socially embedded ‘common’ management institutions and explain the evolution of these arrangements through dynamic interactions between individuals, communities and the agents of the state. Through describing the ‘living space’ of Gaddi shepherds across the annual cycle of nomadic migration with their ﬂocks I explore the ways in which they have been able to creatively reinterpret external interventions, and suggest how contemporary arrangements for accessing pasture at different moments of the annual cycle involve complex combinations of the formal and the informal, the ‘traditional’ and the ‘modern’.",

However, a longitudinal study of mobile pastoralists in the Far North Region of Cameroon shows that open access is not the absence of rules and does not lead to a tragedy of the commons. Current theoretical models cannot explain this phenomenon of management of common-pool grazing resources in a situation of open access. Here I propose a new property regime – an open property regime – that solves this paradox. First, I will explain how open property regimes function as complex adaptive systems using our study of mobile pastoralists in Cameroon. Second, I will describe four other cases of pastoral systems with similar open property regimes. Finally, I discuss the key characteristics that these pastoral systems have in common and outline a new theoretical model of open property regimes.",

This report attempts to capture core problems confronting these communities with the COVID lockdown and identifies solutions to help them sustain their livelihood during and post the lockdown in May 2020.\nIt is based on interactions with pastoralists and members of civil society organisations in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, and media reports. Given the difficulties of establishing contact with mobile pastoralist communities, the report does not attempt to be comprehensive. It is a sampling of different communities, located in different parts of the country. The objective is to provide an overview of the kinds of issues pastoralists confront under this unprecedented lockdown. Where possible, we have provided names of communities, their locations and the specific issues they are dealing with. We have highlighted instances where proactive government action has eased conditions for these communities.",

This increase in herding contracts has been held responsible for major changes, including constraints on pastoral mobility and breakdown of rangeland management institutions. In a longitudinal study of pastoral mobility and management of common-pool grazing resources in the Far North Region of Cameroon, we examined the impact of herding contracts on pastoral mobility and management of common-pool grazing resources. Our analyses indicate that there are no major differences in mobility patterns between herds under contract (HUC) and independent herds (IH), and that absentee owners are as committed to the ethos and practice of open access as independent herders. We end with a discussion of the critical role of absentee owners in the mobile pastoral system.",

        "abstractNote": "One of China’s newest large-scale ‘ecological construction’ projects, ‘converting pastures to grasslands’ (tuimu huancao), calls for the creation of three new types of zones on existing pastures: zones in which grazing is to be permanently banned, zones in which grazing is to cease for a period of several years, and zones in which pasture is to be seasonally closed. This project is likely to signiﬁcantly alter the livelihoods of tens of thousands of pastoralists living in Western China. The paper discusses the policy context in which tuimu huancao emerged, analyzing both continuities with and disjunctures from previous ecological restoration and rangeland management policies, including ‘Open up the West,’ the Sloping Land Conversion Project, and the ‘four that form a complete set’ (si peitao). Differences suggest that tuimu huancao constitutes a deepening of state control over territory, and can be understood as an emergent form of green governmentality in China. The paper then discusses tuimu huancao implementation on the Tibetan plateau, speciﬁcally in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. Finally, directions for future research are outlined.",

        "abstractNote": "Nomadic pastoralism has thrived in Asia’s rangelands for several millennia by tracking seasonal changes in forage productivity and coping with a harsh climate. This pastoralist lifestyle, however, has come under intense transformations in recent decades due to socio-political and land use changes. One example is of the high-altitude trans-Himalayan rangelands of the Jammu and Kashmir State in northern India: major socio-political reorganisation over the last five decades has significantly impacted the traditional pasture use pattern and resources. We outline the organizational transformations and movement patterns of the Rupshu pastoralists who inhabit the region. We demonstrate the changes in terms of intensification of pasture use across the region as well as a social reorganisation due to accommodation of Tibetan refugees following the Sino-Indian war in 1961 to 1962. We focus in particular on the Tso Kar basin - an important socio-ecological system of livestock herding and biodiversity in the eastern Ladakh region. The post-war developmental policies of the government have contributed to these modifications in traditional pasture use and present a threat to the rangelands as well as to the local biodiversity. In the Tso Kar basin, the number of households and livestock has almost doubled while pasture area has declined by half. These changes have potentially negative consequences for the long-term resilience of nomadic pastoralism as well as for the survival of rare local wildlife. To increase the pastoralist standard of living, having fewer pastoralists may be the only solution, and alternative livelihood options may bring this about. Development programmes should concentrate on enhancing opportunities for herders so that there is a greater diversity of employment opportunities and potentially better chances for the persistence of biodiversity.",

The paper suggests, using a simple analytical framework, that the existing distribution of decision-making during migration helps the Raikas to utilize available economies of scale, represent the different interest groups in their collectives, and control their decision-makers. At the same time, the ordinary shepherds in the camp are able to extract a comfortable subsistence from a complex and harsh environment by delegating much of their decision-making responsibilities to the leaders in the camp. To the extent shepherds in other parts of the world migrate over long distances and must confront similar issues of delegation of responsibilities and control over decision-makers, the analysis holds general relevance.]",

        "abstractNote": "Across the globe, conservation policies have often suppressed nonscientific forms of knowledge and ways of knowing nature, along with the social practices of the groups that are informed by such knowledge. Reversing this process of epistemic supremacy is crucial both for achieving greater cognitive justice in conservation areas and ensuring that conservation aims are achieved. Doing so, however, is not an easy task. In situations of cultural violence, hidden environmental knowledge is not easily made visible unless adequate conditions for it to emerge are created. I show that one way forward is by conservation engaging with the well-being agendas of indigenous people, in particular, with the construction of their life plans. This discussion is illustrated through a case study in Canaima National Park, Venezuela, where over the last 20 years, social-ecological research has been studying existing conflicts over the use of fire while supporting the development of Pemon (the indigenous peoples in this area) Life Plans. Assisting in the development of life plans through participatory historical reconstructions, territorial self-demarcation processes, and facilitation of community reflexivity about its social-ecological changes and desired future has been decisive for the Pemon, and has revealed fire management knowledge that challenges conventional explanations of landscape change that simplistically place the blame for such changes on the local use of fire. This local knowledge, combined with results from studies of Pemon fire regimes, fire behavior ecology, and paleoecological research, now informs a counter narrative of landscape change that is influencing a shift in environmental discourse and policy-making toward an intercultural fire management approach. By documenting how social-ecological research has engaged with the Pemon Life Plan processes, I show the important role that cultural revitalization plays in making hidden and silenced local environmental knowledge more visible, and hence, in achieving greater cognitive justice in conservation.",

When the polar classes of capitalism leave much lying between them under conditions of generalized commodity production and circulation, where expansion is driven by multiplication of tiny units of production and trade rather than, or as well as, accumulation, what is to be done? In response to Saumyajit Bhattacharya’s charge (in this issue) that the discourse used to explore PCP can support the de-legitimation of labour politics, this essay examines the deﬁnitions of, evidence for, and interpretation of DWL and PCP in the Indian case. It then addresses the theoretical and practical importance of PCP, its persistence, problems of its legal status and its politics.",

        "abstractNote": "Kissidougou's landscape is striking. Over open expanses of grassy savanna tower patches of dense, verdant, semi-deciduous rainforest. These forest islands, scattered over the gently rolling hills, are generally circular, perhaps a kilometre or two in diameter, and most conceal at their centre one of the prefecture's 800 or so villages. Apart from these islands, dense forest vegetation is found only in narrow strips along streamsides or swampy valley bottoms. This landscape resembles that in many parts of the West African forest–savanna mosaic or ‘transition’ zone, which stretches along the northern fringe of the forest zone from Sierra Leone eastwards to Nigeria and beyond (figure 0.1).Since the first French occupation in 1893, Guinée's administrators have been convinced that these forest patches are the last relics of an original dense humid forest which once fully covered the landscape. They suppose that inhabitants have progressively converted this forest into ‘derived’ savanna through their shifting cultivation and fire-setting practices, preserving only the narrow belts of forest around their villages. From the outset, this ‘savannisation’ has been a major policy concern because of the threat it posed to the local agricultural and tree crop economy and to regional climate and hydrology. Today, and with the addition of global environmental concerns, the degraded and degrading landscape of Kissidougou attracts major international funding for environmental rehabilitation. These concerns are not unique to Kissidougou: they have been expressed thoughout much of the transition zone, and elaborated during a century of scientific investigation.",

        "abstractNote": "Reducing vulnerability to hazards is a major challenge for pastoral settlements in the dry lands of sub-Saharan Africa. Accumulation of a stock of living animals is a major means of livelihood security that pastoralists use to cope with their constraints, amongst which is high environmental variability. Diversification and long-distance mobility are other means of livelihood security, implying specific family organization. We analysed the combination of these means in ensuring the livelihood security of 508 familial settlements in the rural community of Ferlo, Tessekre (Senegal). At least 40% of the settlements surveyed were small pastoral families, composed of one or two households with small herds (less than 50 cows and 50 sheep). Herds were the major means of livelihood security, but due to lack of a sufficient labour and other assets, the situation of these impoverished families was very precarious. In 28% of the settlements, families combined livestock, crops and non-farming activities as livelihood means. The remaining 32% of the settlements were pastoral settlements supported by large cattle herds and, in many cases, the production of Aïd el Kebir rams (for the major Muslim religious event). Non-farming activities were also present in these settlements with large herds, especially activities in the livestock trade. Diversification can reinforce the function of herds as savings accounts and might also enable the pastoralists to invest in livestock activities. There were three groups of settlements based on the characterization of livelihood security strategies used by pastoral herders. Over time, pastoralists have to utilize several means of security to cope with climatic shocks such as droughts, and familial events such as the death of the familial chief. Family organization (dispersal or grouping), diversification and mobility are important means used to recover after major losses of animals.",

Abstract?This review asks the question: What new avenues of social science enquiry are suggested by new ecological thinking, with its focus on nonequilibrium dynamics, spatial and temporal variation, complexity, and uncertainty? Following a review of the emergence of the ?new ecology? and the highlighting of contrasts with earlier ?balance of nature? perspectives, work emerging from ecological anthropology, political ecology, environmental and ecological economics, and debates about nature and culture are examined. With some important exceptions, much social science work and associated popular and policy debates remain firmly wedded to a static and equilibrial view. This review turns to three areas where a more dynamic perspective has emerged. Each has the potential to take central elements of new ecological thinking seriously, sometimes with major practical consequences for planning, intervention design, and management. First is the concern with spatial and temporal dynamics developed in detailed and situated analyses of ?people in places,? using, in particular, historical analysis as a way of explaining environmental change across time and space. Second is the growing understanding of environment as both the product of and the setting for human interactions, which link dynamic structural analyses of environmental processes with an appreciation of human agency in environmental transformation, as part of a ?structuration? approach. Third is the appreciation of complexity and uncertainty in social-ecological systems and, with this, the recognition of that prediction, management, and control are unlikely, if not impossible.",

Villagers regard migration as necessary yet problematic. Migration provides income for village families yet undercuts traditions of community service and disrupts the integrity of local development networks that link the community to NGOs, state bureaucracies, and product markets. As a consequence, villagers engage in a cultural politics of negotiation and contestation that moulds both the meanings of migration, and the village social practices that regulate migration. Regulation operates via the setting of norms for village communal labor participation: those who do not undertake assigned tasks (cargos and tequios) face loss of usufruct of communal lands. This ﬁnding of strong sending community agency is contrasted with recent migration studies that emphasize the agency of migrant networks and transnational spaces. The paper presents a case study of migration that examines the exercise of community agency via collective labor participation, and the study concludes by calling for a greater analytical focus on the cultural politics of sending communities.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper discusses several recent and influential workings of materiality, and examines their implications for resource geographies. First, we identify a set of analytical questions at the heart of resource geography and characterize the dominant approaches to these questions - the 'production of nature and the 'social construction of nature'- as yielding diminishing returns. Second, we survey recent work on materiality relating to commodities, corporeality and hybridity and advance the claim that this work provides a number of fresh perspectives with which to revive resource geography. Third, we highlight three specific themes within this research: a radical redistribution and decentering of agency; a revitalization of the concept of 'construction'; and an acknowledgement of the political-economic implications that flow from a world that is biophysically heterogeneous. Finally, we draw on this analysis to explore how progress might be made in the conceptualization and empirical study of resources.",

        "abstractNote": "The Buddhist Changpas-pastoral nomads of Changthang, Ladakh form an ethnic entity. Like other nomads in the world, the pastoral nomads of Changthang are a minority, suffering problems of under representation, social, economic and geographic marginalisation. The region is extremely poor in conventional energy sources (fossils, fuel and wood) and has almost no industrially exploitable resources. Natural environmental limitations dictate many aspects of traditional life, especially settlement pattern and economic system. Among the Changpas, the pastoral mode of livelihood is an evident attempt to adapt to a natural environment, which provides no plants as food that can support humans and has no potential for growing food crops. Under such conditions, the only solution is to domesticate large herds of various animals, which can feed off the plants and in return, the animals can sustain humans. Since, the ecological conditions of Changthang are not favourable for crop growing, the Changpas raise large herds of sheep and goats as well as transport animals like yaks and horses. These animals provide the Changpas with meat, milk, varieties of wool, which they use themselves and barter for grains and other utilities. This economic interdependence of nomadic pastoral and settled population has been an important characteristic of the society in this area. The Changpas social behaviour is, in part, a response to constraints and opportunities of the natural environment. Both stability and change are outcomes of response to the immediate needs of daily life. The basic form of social organisation in the area was rural, and social relations among the agriculturalists, nomadic and semi-nomadic groups were based on trade and exchange of essential commodities. The Changpas’ subsistence level pastoral economy, traditional social and religio-cultural systems are composite part of cold desert’s ecological system. Their way of life shows a capacity to adapt themselves to the rugged cold desert environment. The Changpas possess a high degree of specialised knowledge and a flexible social organisation to make viable the mobile mode of production. Despite the ecological constraints, the Changpas were managing their environment for making a living without outside intervention. Their own societal controls like polyandry and cutting of excess animals, helped in turn by their customary rights and equity in resource allocation has helped them. The Changpas are organised using a patrilineal idiom, all members being patrilineal descendants of the founding ancestor. Rangeland, livestock, manpower and the considerable knowledge of the skills necessary to exploit them effectively are the principle economic resources of the Changpas of Changthang. Resource management in a risky environment illustrates the skills of the Changpas for survival. Traditional practices of Changpas, such as the rotation of grazing areas and use of reserve pastures in case of natural calamities help manage the variability of ecosystem and bail out pastures from a state of permanent degradation. Each animal has its own specific characteristics and adaptation to the environment. Rearing together different animals maximised the use of vegetation in the pasture. Different animals graze on different plants. In recent decades, the Changpas of Changthang have been experiencing changes due to external pressures that have altered political, economic and social landscapes. Traditionally, the Changpas were self-sufficient and livestock were providing them with their food and lodging. In recent decades, continuous massive defense investments and improvement in communications; proliferation of government departments; introduction of development plans; provision for basic amenities, alterations in traditional subsistence economy, its commercialisation and extension of know-how through government departments and non-government organisations and tourism has led to a higher motivation among local people for better standards of living. Increasing administrative and market integration and population growth over the years have weakened socio-homeostasis with no functional substitutes for restoring positive social system. For centuries, pastoralists in Changthang have lived in the context of environmental uncertainty and have developed a diverse range of strategies, institutions and network to minimise this unpredict-ability and risk. Pastoral management strategies, which may have worked previously, may or may not be sufficient now. The three communities of Samad, Korzok and Kharnak responded differently to these changes. Various pressures with an ever-increasing rate of change necessitated the adoption of new strategies for survival.",

Animals in agriculture are examined as an extreme example of animal commodification whose use resembles the exploitation of land and labor. Conceptual frameworks developed from Marxist theory, including the subsumption of nature, the second contradiction of capitalism, and alienation, are applied to illustrate how the negative impacts to animals, the environment, and public health associated with animal agriculture are caused by attempts to overcome the incomplete commodification of animals. This paper illustrates how social theory can be extended to apply to animals, especially animals who are deeply embedded in human society. The inclusion of animals in social analyses also serves to strengthen our overall understanding of exploitation and oppression under capitalism.",

The nomadic people rear a variety of livestock such as sheep, goats, horses and yaks, which provide them with various goods and services. Nevertheless, the needs and aspirations of the people are changing. There is a trend towards increasing the livestock population, especially of a breed of goat that produces one of the ﬁnest natural ﬁbres: Pashmina, which is the mainstay of their economy. This increase in goat population, however, is jeopardising the long-term survival of the wild herbivores in the region, and as such is not sustainable. We present information on the current trends in socio-economy, Pashmina production, wildlife conservation, and the conﬂicts of interest between wildlife and nomads in the region. On the basis of this information, we make suggestions for the conservation of natural resources in the region. We recommend preserving the historical societal norms and notions of the people, and capitalising on them to manage natural resources. We also recommend joint management of natural resources by the local people, State and non-governmental organisations. Our ﬁndings provide a platform on which a grazing policy for the region may be formulated.",

With every passing day, the farmer’s struggle against the farm laws intensifies in defence of their livelihoods and the food security rights of all citizens. Unregulated agriculture markets facilitated by the laws, the farmers assert, will drive small and marginal farmers into penury and push them out of agriculture. The government insists that farmers will benefit with enhanced incomes from deregulated agriculture markets.",

While extraction from its vast agrarian hinterland was a crucial source of revenue, realizing those surpluses was critically dependent on the Mughal horse-borne cavalry, which comprised its main fighting arm and was a defining feature of its military strength. However, supporting this equine-based resource depended on enabling a constant and voluminous supply of fodder. The Mughal Empire, in other words, sought to sustain an ecological hoofprint, so to speak, that involved the cultivation and systematic transport of a range of nutritious grasses.",

This study draws on qualitative data to identify and categorize the various indigenous adaptation strategies of herdsmen in cattle production. The results reveal multiple indigenous strategies of climate change adaptation in cattle herding among the Fulani. These include mobility-based strategies, diversification of sources of feed, labour division for meeting differentiated needs of cattle, and stress management in cattle. The results suggest that the integration of indigenous knowledge in climate change adaptation planning is imperative for developing socially acceptable and sustainable adaptation strategies. This will require a bridge of the differences between formal and informal stakeholders in adaptation planning by creating a common platform for dialogue at all levels in arid environments.",

Typical explanations for this change use models of population pressure; increasing herds and decreasing pasture are held to blame. This explanation, however intuitive, is unsatisfactory. Instead, changing institutional and economic patterns are creating new contexts for strategic movement. Bottlenecks in the yearly resource calendar, caused by the disintegration of obligatory social relationships, force migrations during periods of scarcity. Changes in the volume and pattern of the meat and wool markets have also created opportunities for migrating pastoralists. Producers increase their access to markets and the reproductive rate of their herd through long, annual, migration. While nomadism is a general adaptation to changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the region, differential resource endowments account for the range of strategies; wealthy herders have opportunities not enjoyed by more marginal producers.]",

Grazing ecology in the Sahel will be the primary focus but the general points are relevant to other land uses in the Sahel and other dryland regions. The first section of the paper will briefly characterize conventional views of range management and grazing-induced environmental change in the Sahel. It will be argued that these understandings are have been shaped more by rigid adherence to inappropriate ecological models, developmentalist agendas, and state interests than by good science. This will be followed by a section that discusses how results from more process oriented grazing ecology research leads to different conceptualizations of grazing induced environmental degradation and management interventions.",

These ecosystems are anticipated to be particularly sensitive to future changes in climate, and understanding how these systems have responded to climatic changes in the past can provide us with insights into their potential responses to future global change. In this study, the temporal dynamics of C3-C4 vegetation changes in response to changes in moisture availability, local fire events and changing levels of herbivory in a summer-rainfall region of Western India are reconstructed for the past ~4600 cal yr BP. Paleodata such as stable carbon isotope of bulk organic matter (δ13Corg), oxygen isotope from carbonate shells (δ18Oshell), macro-charcoal and herbivore dung fungal spores are reported from the retrieved cores of two wetland sites located in the Banni grasslands of Western India. Results show that vegetation in the Banni was composed mostly of C3 vegetation from ~4600 to ~2500 cal yr BP, after which there was a decline in C3 vegetation. From the late-Holocene to the present, there was a mix of both C3 and C4 vegetation, with C4 grasses being more abundant in the ecosystem. These shifts were coincident with rainfall changes from more mesic conditions during ~4600 to ~2500 cal yr BP to more arid conditions towards the present as indicated by δ18Oshell isotope data. The period of increase in C4 vegetation also coincides with a period of increased biotic disturbances in the ecosystem, particularly fire. Given the current scenarios of global warming, recurrent drought events and increased anthropogenic use of similar ecosystems, such studies can provide us insights into potential future trajectories of these ecosystems.",

Turkey figures prominently, but only the western part of the country is mentioned. From the eastern part, the Kurdish region, nothing seems to filter through. In fact, for the past 40 years, Kurdish shepherds and their traditions seem to have been forgotten by the pastoral world and also by Kurdish elites. After the period of conflict in the 1980s and 1990s, a general ethnographic updating is due.\nResults: Pastoralism in southeast Turkey has two aspects: village pastoralism and pastoralism with vertical and horizontal movements. The latter comes in many forms and is practiced by seminomads or nomads within complex issues of identity.\nConclusions: The daily lives of these Kurdish shepherds are affected by the changes in their environment and the difficulties of the Turkish nation at whole. Today, Kurdish pastoralism is a heritage that remains to be assessed, which includes an example of enclosed nomadism in a settled context, that is able to persist notwithstanding its adaptability and malleability.",

        "abstractNote": "The effects of the invasive exotic Prosopis juliflora shrubs on the natural plant communities and soil chemical characters were assessed in two regions of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Five sites were selected subjectively: three in Sharja with 73 stands and two in Ras Al-Khima with 37 stands. Stands were located randomly within each site to cover density variation in Sharja and size variation in Ras Al-Khima. Density, frequency, richness and evenness of the associated annual and perennial species were studied in nine quadrats distributed under, at the margin and outside the canopy of a P. juliflora shrub located in the center of each stand. The results indicated that the effect of P. juliflora on the associated flora depends significantly on the density and size of the canopy. Larger individuals and greater densities have significantly greater negative impacts on the associated plants. All the studied community attributes were significantly lower under P. juliflora canopies than outside. Annuals were inhibited more than perennials. The number of annuals with significant reductions in density and/or frequency under P. juliflora canopies was significantly greater than the number of perennials. Density of more than 50% of the associated annuals was significantly inhibited under P. juliflora canopies. Density of P. juliflora seedlings was greater underneath the canopy of the same species than away from them, indicating little or no self allelopathic effect (auto-inhibition) under field conditions. P. juliflora ameliorated some soil characters, through significant pH reduction and increase in K, N and P and organic matters. Hence, plant diversity might be enhanced following eradication of P. juliflora.",

This argument is based on fieldwork in Gambella, Addis Ababa, and Minneapolis and is situated within the broader development agenda pursued by Ethiopia’s ruling party. The political economy of LSLAs tells us that the deals are not occurring in a predominantly economic manner; rather, extra-economic state intervention clears the way for, facilitates, and ensures sustained accumulation. This political intervention is “unlocking” and making the lowland resources accessible and extractable by the state, while a concomitant villagisation project is guaranteeing continued accumulation by disempowering the local population by making the community legible, governable, and controllable. By combining these processes, the Ethiopian state is mastering, and building itself in, Gambella’s lowlands.",

        "abstractNote": "This article argues on the basis of a comparative study in floodplain areas in Cameroon, Tanzania, and Zambia that land tenure issues have to be related to historical institutional changes not only to property rights in land, but also to land related common pool resources. It further outlines that in addition to privatisation of resources, pastoralists face challenges from the fragmentation of cultural landscape ecosystems, which serves to undermine local common property institutions and their reciprocal resource management arrangements that provided resilience in floodplain ecosystems. Colonisation and postcolonial constellations led to a major institutional change from common to state property in African rangelands, and created legal and institutional pluralism which enabled more powerful state and wealthy actors to shop for institutions that suit them best, especially privatisation and open access constellations (Haller 2010). The article argues that it is this institutional change that transformed the previous cultural landscape ecosystems, that conservationists and governments now want to protect by excluding pastoralists. It will analyse how governments and environmentalists increase their bargaining power in order to appropriate these landscapes in the form of land as commons and green grabbing. It will do so by combining a New Institutionalism and Political Ecology approach (NIPE) with Appadurai’s notion of scapes (1996) in a way that unpacks power dynamics for legitimacy-based governmentalities that link global and local scales. The article unpacks the idea of ideoscapes and adds a four-step historical phases model to the concept. This illustrates the scapes pastoralists are in (state, neoliberal, neoliberal applied including investment and conservation, and terrorism and control scapes). These scapes provide legitimacy capital for powerful actors, shape platforms for strategic selection of institutions (institution shopping) and act as Anti-Politics Machines (APM).",

Policies to support such climate adjusted, resource attuned lifestyles are either absent or not pursued. This paper looks at nomadic pastoralism, sifting through available literature on the subject and through the story of a pastoralist group in the semi-arid state of Rajasthan, in northern India. Highlighting the significance of pastoralism to the livelihoods and State economy, food security, and the social and bio-physical infrastructures, the paper attempts to outline the need for notifying State policies on pastoralism considering five main inter-linked components. These include – (a) strengthening and augmenting the contribution of pastoralism to the economy and food security; (b) securing and protecting the lives and livelihoods of pastoralists and ensuring their rights to dignified and honorable living; (c) securing their rights to forests, land and water resources that are central to their existence; (d) recognizing, collaborating and promoting the role of pastoralists in conservation and management of State’s biodiversity and natural resources; and (e) developing collaborative systems for periodic enumeration of pastoralist populations, measuring their economic contributions and supporting mobility.",

Putting in place a proper policy framework may not only restore normalcy in the region, but can start a recovery boom. Estimating the loss from the earthquake is important for devising policies and drawing up requirements for assistance both from within and outside India. However, given all the limitations of the data, firm estimates of losses from the recent quake will take time to compile. In the interim, quantification is critical for designing relief and rehabilitation packages and implementing them before the onset of the monsoon. This paper is an attempt to estimate the economic impact of the earthquake.]",

Such assumptions reflect a theoretical framework which had been questioned since the 1970s and was openly disproved in scientific circles during the 1990s, when it was shown to be fundamentally inadequate. Today, lingering equilibrium assumptions in the methodological legacy of pastoral development get in the way of operationalising state-of-the-art understanding of pastoral systems and drylands. Unless these barriers are identified, unpacked and managed, even increasing the rigour and intensity of data collection will not deliver a realistic representation of pastoral systems in statistics and policymaking. This article provides a range of examples of such 'barriers', where equilibrium assumptions persist in the methodology, including classifications of livestock systems, conventional scales of observation, key parameters in animal production, indicators in the measurement of ecological efficiency, and the concepts of 'fragile environment', natural resources, and pastoral risk.",

In the past few years, rustling activities have resulted in the theft of a huge number of cows, deaths of people and destruction of property. Daily reports across the northern region have confirmed that catde rustlings have significandy contributed to the increasing security challenges facing the Nigerian state and seem to have become big business involving the herders, big-time syndicates, and heavily armed bandits. However, despite the growing level of catde rustling and its consequences for society, the situation has yet to receive adequate scholarly interrogation.

Using three of the more comprehensive such studies, and with an extensive review of writings on the commons, this paper demonstrates that the enterprise of generating lists of conditions under which commons are governed sustainably is a ¯awed and impossibly costly research task. For a way out, the paper examines the relative merits of statistical, comparative, and case study approaches to studying the commons. It ends with a plea for careful research design and sample selection, construction of causal mechanisms, and a shift toward comparative and statistical rather than single-case analyses. Such steps are necessary for a coherent, empirically-relevant theory of the commons. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Clearly there can be no definition of wasteland other than that which draws attention to its defining feature of uselessness. What is to be investigated then, is whether this land and its produce, if any, has a use value at all. This article, based on a study in the Sikar district of Rajasthan, juxtaposes the state's view (incorporating the scientists' definition) of wastelands to the villagers' perception of the commons which draws its characteristics and validity from the shared context of local inhabitants.",

These areas, mostly located in the southern and western parts of the region, were historically used by herders as dry season grazing rangelands, while they presently house permanent settlements populated by now sedentarised ‘marginal farmers’, town-based workers and patriarchal elites. In this article, I advance the concept of ‘de-pastoralisation’ to explain the process of dispossession of the major means of social reproduction, which causes an increase in livelihoods diversiﬁcation and in social diﬀerentiation. Through the concept of de-pastoralisation, this article aims to investigate the historical dissolution of pastoralism and its socio-economic consequences, characterised by exploitative inter and intra household relations of production, leading to processes of general proletarianisation and male elite accumulation that reproduce inequality over time.",

Pastoralism as a practice involves the seasonally mobile management of domesticated animal herds via extensive grazing on common pool resources, with at least 50 percent of household revenues coming from this kind of animal husbandry. By this definition, pastoralism does not include intensively managed livestock (such as stall-fed dairies) or immobile households that manage a few animals that might be grazed on village commons, generating a small fraction of household revenues from their livestock. Importantly, pastoral communities are also commonly associated with particular breeds of animals, breeds that they have played a key role in developing. Unlike such systems elsewhere, India’s pastoralism is largely agro- pastoral with complex inter-dependencies between pastoral and cultivating communities.",

Individual households have increased their involvements in the new market economy, although the nature and extent of those involvements have been conditioned by local resource availability and proximity to markets. People have begun purchasing a varied array of modern consumption goods, they have increased their sales of pastoral products and sold more products whose prices have risen. Younger men also have begun working for wages in local towns. However, households have continued to resist government outreach offices’ directives on herd management and marketing, to treat animals as commodities to be bought and sold to achieve some target herd size. The paper evaluates these findings in light of longstanding anthropological debates about the economic rationality of pastoralist practices.",

Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in western India, this paper challenges this reductive dichotomy and unpacks the many (im)mobilities produced, accessed, experienced and imagined by pastoralists. Adopting a relational lens, it shows how mobilities and immobilities co-constitute and are contingent on each other across social, geographical and temporal scales. Embedded within their own social and political history, the many forms that mobility can take dispel, ontologically, the homogenising effects of rigid typologies, but it also practically offers the capacity to adapt to changing times.",

        "abstractNote": "The focus of this article is two home-grown insurgencies which arose in Nigeria after the return to civilian rule in 1999: Boko Haram in the Muslim northeast, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) in the oil producing and Christian southeast. The two insurgencies arose, I argue, from frontier spaces in which the limits of state authority and legitimacy intersected with a profound crisis of authority and rule on the one hand, and the political economy of radical precarity on the other. Boko Haram and MEND share family resemblances—they are products of the same orderings of power—despite the obvious fact that one is draped in the language of religion and restoration (but as we shall see modernity) and the insistence that Nigeria should become transformed into a true Islamic state, while the other is secular and civic (and also modern) wishing to expand the boundaries of citizenship through a new sort of federalism. There are striking commonalities in the social composition of the armed groups and their internal dynamics; each is deposited at the nexus of the failure of local government, customary institutions, and the security forces (the police and the military task forces in particular). Each, nevertheless, is site speciﬁc; a cultural articulation of dispossession politics rooted in regional traditions of warfare, in particular systems of religiosity, and very diﬀerent sorts of social structure and identity, and very diﬀerent ecologies (the semi arid savannas of the north, and the creeks and forest of the Niger delta). In both cases state coercion and despotism and the ethicomoral decrepitude of the state ﬁgures centrally as does the politics of resentment that each condition generates among a large, alienated but geographically rooted group of precarious classes.",

We argue that state lands constitute today’s frontiers for capitalist expansion. Using cases from Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Indonesia, we show how practices, institutions, and laws that expunge local rights and claims to land and replace them with state rights have been fundamental to the creation of ‘‘new’’ frontiers. We argue that historical formalizations of state land created the enabling conditions for today’s large-scale, international, and national acquisitions of land, in ways that were unanticipated at the time of state acquisition.",

        "abstractNote": "A large number of East African pastoralists reside around protected areas (PAs). Over the last few decades pastoralists have been affected by the loss of grazing lands and increasing climatic variability. Many pastoralists who reside around PAs have resorted to grazing inside PAs to counter environmental variability. However, there is little information on how PAs influence the herding strategies of pastoralists. This case study from southern Kenya employs a spatially and temporally explicit mixedmethods approach to understand and evaluate the herding strategies of pastoralists around a PA. The results find that pastoralists access PAs on a regular basis, regardless of seasonality or herd size. Movement into PAs was partly driven by the loss of grazing land to conservancies. PAs affected pastoral herding by presenting differential opportunity costs to disparate groups. However, households with large herd sizes utilized the most flexible strategies to counter environmental variability and uncertainty.",

        "abstractNote": "Human–wildlife conflict arising from livestock-losses to large carnivores is an important challenge faced by conservation. Theory of prey–predator interactions suggests that revival of wild prey populations can reduce predator’s dependence on livestock in multiple-use landscapes. We explore whether 10-years of conservation efforts to revive wild prey could reduce snow leopard’s Panthera uncia consumption of livestock in the coupled human-and-natural Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India. Starting in 2001, concerted conservation efforts at one site (intervention) attempted recovery of wildprey populations by creating livestock-free reserves, accompanied with other incentives (e.g. insurance, vigilant herding). Another site, 50 km away, was monitored as status quo without any interventions. Prey remains in snow leopard scats were examined periodically at five-year intervals between 2002 and 2012 to determine any temporal shift in diet at both sites to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Consumption of livestock increased at the status quo site, while it decreased at the intervention-site. At the intervention-site, livestock-consumption reduced during 2002–2007 (by 17%, p = 0.06); this effect was sustained during the next five-year interval, and it was accompanied by a persistent increase in wild prey populations. Here we also noted increased predator populations, likely due to immigration into the study area. Despite the increase in the predator population, there was no increase in livestock-consumption. In contrast, under status quo, dependence on livestock increased during both five-year intervals (by 7%, p = 0.08, and by 16%, p = 0.01, respectively). These contrasts between the trajectories of the two sites suggest that livestock-loss can potentially be reduced through the revival of wild prey. Further, accommodating counter-factual scenarios may be an important step to infer whether conservation efforts achieve their targets, or not.",

This livelihood diversification has complex origins and profound implications for Maasai social organization, culture, and demography, and ultimately for their health and well being and for the local and regional environment. In this paper, we examine the process by which this engagement with, and increasing dependence upon, agriculture came about in Ngorongoro District, northern Tanzania. The process there was more complex and influenced by a wider variety of factors than has been reported by previous descriptions of Maasai livelihood diversification. It generally involved two stages: planting a garden first, and later expanding the garden to a farm. We found that some households adopted cultivation out of necessity, but far more did so by choice. Among the latter, some adopted cultivation to reduce risk, while for others it was a reflection of changing cultural and social norms. Motivations for adopting cultivation differed among people of different wealth categories. Diversification was part of wider cultural changes, and was also influenced by power differentials among Maasai age sets and by government policies.",

Specifically it focuses on the case of the nomadic Gaddi shepherds and official attempts to regulate their access to grazing pastures in the Indian Himalayas. It is often predicted that the increased presence of the modern state critically undermines locally appropriate and community-based resource management arrangements. Drawing on the work of Pauline Peters and Francis Cleaver, I identify key instances of socially embedded ?common? management institutions and explain the evolution of these arrangements through dynamic interactions between individuals, communities and the agents of the state. Through describing the ?living space? of Gaddi shepherds across the annual cycle of nomadic migration with their flocks I explore the ways in which they have been able to creatively reinterpret external interventions, and suggest how contemporary arrangements for accessing pasture at different moments of the annual cycle involve complex combinations of the formal and the informal, the ?traditional? and the ?modern?.",

The Malian case shows that lack of broad access to formalisation processes in high-pressure areas may play into the hands of those with power, information, and resources. The case also demonstrates that timing of formalisation efforts in urban areas characterised by rapid expansion is crucial in terms of distributive outcomes. The Nigerien case demonstrates how impending formalisation led to a scramble for land and increased conﬂicts in a context of institutional competition and limited administrative capacity. The South African case shows that the very process of surveying and registering rights may also change the rights themselves. Formalisation procedures may also amplify the tension between individual and communal rights, and boost privatisation.",

In Kenya and Ethiopia, these visions include flagship projects in the geographical frontiers, areas previously viewed as buffer zones, whose people have been historically marginalised. This paper adapts the analytical framework from James Scott’s Seeing Like a State in order to compare Kenya’s and Ethiopia’s state visions, and to understand the risks to the populations intended to benefit from such visions from the unintended (but predictable) consequences such projects have had in the past.",

Thirteen articles are introduced around six themes that have characterised IDS-linked research over this period. These are: pastoral livelihoods; institutions and common property resource management; climate change and ecological dynamics; food security, early warning, and livelihood vulnerability; pastoral marketing; and conflict and governance. Across these themes, IDS research has challenged mainstream development thinking and practice, highlighting the importance of mobility and living with uncertainty. This introductory article concludes with some reflections on research gaps and new challenges, including: the effects of climate change; new forms of pastoral mobility and livelihood; increasing patterns of commoditisation and social differentiation; and changing conflict dynamics. Although massively changed over 50 years, and despite repeated proclamations of crisis and collapse, pastoralism remains, we argue, an important, resilient source of livelihood in marginal rangeland areas across the world, from which others can learn.",

This paper draws on a growing body of evidence on the emergence of vernacular rural land sales and rental markets to question assumptions that underlie the nonmarket ‘ideal type’ communal tenure model that has historically dominated policy thinking in Africa, and continues to be shared by both sides of the current land tenure reform debate. The paper argues that recognition of the speciﬁc characteristics of ‘vernacular land markets’ – commoditized transfers of land within the framework of customary tenure – is essential if state land policies are to succeed in promoting the interests of the poor.",

However, many landscape archaeological studies have tended to focus one-sidedly on the recording of archaeological structures and artefacts in the lowlands. Allegedly, the ‘poor’ character of material culture and related to this the difficult retrieval of archaeological remains have discouraged landscape archaeologists from studying the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. This is regrettable, because the relation between plains, valleys and mountains has been a central feature of Mediterranean rural life, especially in regions in which pastoral economies (i.e. sheep herding in particular) have figured prominently. In this article, I will discuss landscape archaeological studies of pastoral economies in the Mediterranean, with particular attention to transhumant patterns of mobility, i.e. seasonal movement of shepherds and their flocks between different regions. I will show that most studies to date have adopted ethno-archaeological approaches in order to aid archaeological interpretations of pastoral economies and their spatial features during prehistoric, classical and medieval times. I will present my ethno-archaeological research on pastoral landscapes in Sardinia, with a focus on how these landscapes have changed over the last 200 years. My contention is that it is possible to study transhumant pastoralism through archaeological methods. In addition, I will show how a landscape archaeological approach in particular can shed new light on the ways in which shepherds inhabited and exploited the countryside.",

        "abstractNote": "Abstract Domestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub-continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68% of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45% of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48% of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large-scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi-pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free-ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.",

In this paper we develop a concept of access and examine a broad set of factors that differentiate access from property. We deﬁne access as “the ability to derive beneﬁts from things,” broadening from property’s classical deﬁnition as “the right to beneﬁt from things.” Access, following this deﬁnition, is more akin to “a bundle of powers” than to property’s notion of a “bundle of rights.” This formulation includes a wider range of social relationships that constrain or enable beneﬁts from resource use than property relations alone. Using this framing, we suggest a method of access analysis for identifying the constellations of means, relations, and processes that enable various actors to derive beneﬁts from resources. Our intent is to enable scholars, planners, and policy makers to empirically “map” dynamic processes and relationships of access.",

        "abstractNote": "The discourse on \"environmental conservation\" is highly dynamic and has generated controversies of epic proportions in conservation sciences and environmental anthropology. Given the nebulous nature of conservation, coupled with the varying interpretations evoked by the deployment of the concept across different disciplines, a more robust understanding of the notion calls into question its practical manifestations and application in particular situated contexts — particularly within the conservation sciences and environmental anthropology. In Zimbabwe, conservation by the state has tended to favour and privilege Western scientific models at the expense of the \"indigenous\" conservation practices of local people, as informed by their indigenous epistemologies. This paper thus represents an attempt to rethink conservation in Zimbabwe, adopting the Norumedzo communal area in south-eastern Zimbabwe as its case study. The choice of Norumedzo is based on the fact that this is one area where the highly esteemed and delicious harurwa (edible stink bugs, Encosternum delegorguei) are found. As a result of these insects being valued as \"actors\" and the appreciation shown to both Western and indigenous epistemologies, conservation in the area has enjoyed considerable success. To this end, this paper lends support to the arguments of Walter Mignolo and Ramon Grosfoguel in their advocacy for critical border thinking in issues of knowledge regarding environmental conservation. Der Diskurs zur \"Bewahrung der Umwelt\" ist ausgesprochen dynamisch und hat in den Umweltwissenschaften und in der Ethnologie zu ausufernden Kontroversen geführt. Angesichts des schwer abzugrenzenden Gegenstandsbereichs und der unterschiedlichen Interpretationen innerhalb der verschiedenen Disziplinen sollte eine schärfere Konturierung des Begriffs seine konkreten Erscheinungsformen und seine Anwendbarkeit in spezifischen Kontexten einbeziehen — insbesondere innerhalb der Umweltwissenschaften und der Ethnologie/Kulturanthropologie. In Zimbabwe stützt sich der öffentliche Naturschutz bevorzugt auf wissenschaftliche Ansätze, die im Westen entstanden sind, und schenkt Praktiken der Umweltbewahrung lokaler Bevölkerungen, die auf ihren hergebrachten Wissenssystemen beruhen, wenig Beachtung. Dieser Beitrag stellt daher einen Versuch dar, den Umweltschutz in Zimbabwe neu zu denken, und zwar unter Bezugnahme auf das Norumedzo-Gebiet im Südosten Zimbabwes. Es wurde deshalb gewählt, weil hier die sehr geschätzten und schmackhaften Harurwa (essbare Stinkwanzen, Encosternum delegorguei) gefunden werden können. Weil diese Insekten als „Akteure“ gesehen werden und sowohl im westlichen als auch im lokalen Denken einen hohen Stellenwert genießen, war der Umweltschutz in dieser Region ausgesprochen erfolgreich. In diesem Sinne unterstützt der vorliegende Beitrag die Argumente Walter Mignolos und Ramon Grosfuguels, die dafür plädieren, zur Bewahrung der Umwelt auf kritisches und die Wissenssysteme überschreitendes Denken zu setzen.",

Independent Gujarat’s initial mass-development strategy centered on agriculture but the emphasis was on productivity and efﬁciency rather than land redistribution or social justice. A state apparatus and socio-political set-up dominated by elite landed upper and middle castes and classes ensured this. Primary ﬁeldwork-based research shows that by the mid-1980s, with a growing acceptance of ideas of liberalisation at the national and international level, the elite consensus on land began to shift. This shift must also be placed within local socio-economic developments that had propelled dominant landed groups into agro-industry and small scale industry in the last third of the twentieth century. Gujarat’s elite still wanted to control land, but they did not want the state to regulate land use or continue emphasising the diluted but powerful rhetoric of land to the tiller. The rightward shift of all political formations in Gujarat after 1985 and the growing importance of the upper caste-middle class merchant-trader-builder-small businessman dominated Bharatiya Janata Party further facilitated the moves towards a shift in land policy. Continuing changes in Gujarat’s land policy are determinedly moving towards the complete liberalisation of land.",

In addition, he describes the growing recognition of factors other than livestock density that affect rangeland vegetation (i.e. density-independent relationships).",

They have variable and harsh climates, are sparsely populated and remote from markets, produce signiﬁcant quantities of livestock, and are mostly used and managed in common. Under this already unpredictable and harsh climate, pastoral peoples and rangelands face new and accelerating political, economic, and climatic stresses that challenge their coupled resilience and ability to adapt. In response, pastoralists are creating new ways to manage rangelands through conservancies and community-based institutions on state, common, and private land. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of rangeland social-ecological systems, as well as on the causes and consequences of change in these systems. We then explore how pastoral peoples, governments, and businesses are responding to these changes to build resilience to sustain both pastoralism and rangelands. We close with a description of unresolved issues, challenges, and questions for the future.",

        "abstractNote": "In dryland areas of the Africa, livestock play important economic roles as commodities, wealth stores, producers of products, and agents of environmental change. Conventional depictions of livestock economies in this region have focused (in support or against) on the need for greater engagement of livestock producers with markets supplying meat to urban areas. This paper argues this singular focus has led analysts to ignore two important aspects of livestock economies: livestock as a preferred store of wealth across a wide range of social groups and the need for specialized labor to manage these livestock across open pastures to maintain their productivity and limit their negative environmental impacts. In the West African Sahel, the capital-like nature of livestock wealth has become more clear with a growing fraction of the region’s livestock owned by investors with little connection to livestock husbandry. Livestock investments are maintained on a day-to-day basis by hired herders who facilitate access to ephemeral pastures and water. A particular concern is the changing geographies of livestock ownership and the herding labor in relationship to regional pastures (to economic and environmental ends). This relationship will be explored using the case study of the Maasina region of central Mali – a historically important livestock region, which is now undergoing signiﬁcant labor emigration. Building from a long-term ethnographic engagement with local livestock owners and herders, the results of ownership surveys of livestock herds across a 14-year period and interviews of urban-based emigrants from the study area about investment decisions will be used to analyze the changing geographies of livestock investment and herding labor in the Maasina.",

        "abstractNote": "Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a type of metastatic cancer, the primary tumor site of which cannot be identified. CUP occupies approximately 5% of cancer incidences in the United States with usually unfavorable prognosis, making it a big threat to public health. Traditional methods to identify the tissue-of-origin (TOO) of CUP like immunohistochemistry can only deal with around 20% CUP patients. In recent years, more and more studies suggest that it is promising to solve the problem by integrating machine learning techniques with big biomedical data involving multiple types of biomarkers including epigenetic, genetic, and gene expression profiles, such as DNA methylation. Different biomarkers play different roles in cancer research; for example, genomic mutations in a patient’s tumor could lead to specific anticancer drugs for treatment; DNA methylation and copy number variation could reveal tumor tissue of origin and molecular classification. However, there is no systematic comparison on which biomarker is better at identifying the cancer type and site of origin. In addition, it might also be possible to further improve the inference accuracy by integrating multiple types of biomarkers. In this study, we used primary tumor data rather than metastatic tumor data. Although the use of primary tumors may lead to some biases in our classification model, their tumor-of-origins are known. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the CUP prediction model built from primary tumors could efficiently predict TOO of metastatic cancers (\n              Lal et al., 2013\n              ;\n              Brachtel et al., 2016\n              ). We systematically compared the performances of three types of biomarkers including DNA methylation, gene expression profile, and somatic mutation as well as their combinations in inferring the TOO of CUP patients. First, we downloaded the gene expression profile, somatic mutation and DNA methylation data of 7,224 tumor samples across 21 common cancer types from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and generated seven different feature matrices through various combinations. Second, we performed feature selection by the Pearson correlation method. The selected features for each matrix were used to build up an XGBoost multi-label classification model to infer cancer TOO, an algorithm proven to be effective in a few previous studies. The performance of each biomarker and combination was compared by the 10-fold cross-validation process. Our results showed that the TOO tracing accuracy using gene expression profile was the highest, followed by DNA methylation, while somatic mutation performed the worst. Meanwhile, we found that simply combining multiple biomarkers does not have much effect in improving prediction accuracy.",

        "abstractNote": "The paper discusses two answers to the question, How to address the harmful effects of technology? The ﬁrst response proposes a complete separation of science from culture, religion, and ethics. The second response ﬁnds harm in the logic and method of science itself. The paper deploys a feminist technoscience approach to overcome these accounts of neutral or deterministic technological agency. In this technoscience perspective, agency is not an attribute of autonomous human users alone but enacted and performed in socio-material conﬁgurations of people and technology and their ‘intra-actions’. This understanding of agency is proposed as an alternative that opens up for the reconﬁguration of design and use for more ethical effects, such as the cultivation of cognitive justice, the equal treatment and representation of different ways of knowing the world. The implication of this approach is that design becomes an adaptive and ongoing intra-active process in which more desirable conﬁgurations of people and technology become possible.",

This article gives an account of the different groups' claims to land in this inter-ethnic setting, which is located in the border area of the vast drylands southeast of the Sahara. Presenting contemporary claims in a narrative form, the authors illustrate how these claims seek legitimacy through reference to historical processes, to first-comer status and to former governments' decisions, to citizenship dues, as well as to \"tribal\" group rights. Taking into account the fact that the broader constitutional, political and social contexts related to these narratives and claims are, at present, in a state of transition, the article seeks to situate the local people's perspectives and local land dynamics within broader discourses on land conflict and land policy reform in Africa. In this way, it also provides context for the series of new inter-ethnic clashes that took place in Isiolo District in 2011.",

Although dogs have been used for the protection of livestock from wild carnivores, they have also been implicated as predators of livestock. We used a combination of methods (field surveys, interview surveys, and data from secondary sources) to examine the patterns and factors driving livestock depredation by free-ranging dogs, as well as economic losses to local communities in a Trans-Himalayan agro-pastoralist landscape in India. Our results show that livestock abundance was a better predictor of depredation in the villages than local dog abundance. Dogs mainly killed small-bodied livestock and sheep were the most selected prey. Dogs were responsible for the majority of livestock losses, with losses being comparable to that by snow leopards. This high level of conflict may disrupt community benefits from conservation programs and potentially undermine the conservation efforts in the region through a range of cascading effects.",

        "abstractNote": "The currently intense debate about ‘land grabs’ or ‘land investment’ in Africa has reinforced the signiﬁcance of relations around land on the continent. This article argues that holders of land under customary tenure face increasing threat and that the role of foreign investors must not obscure the centrality of national agents - governments, political authorities and private actors - in land deals. The article ﬁrst outlines the historical heritage of the colonial construction and post-colonial reproduction of customary tenure and its denial of full property to customary land-holders. The second part considers the escalating competition and conﬂict centered on land; the increase in land transfers implicated in the pervasive social conﬂict focused on land; and the associated rise in social inequality and contestation over belonging and citizenship. All these processes intensify the vulnerability of customarily held land in face of an escalation in efforts to acquire landed resources. The third and ﬁnal part discusses ‘land grabs’, the most recent surge of international interest in African land, and the equally signiﬁcant appropriation of land by national agents. The article concludes that the land question in contemporary Africa has to be linked to the dynamics of social transformation and inequality at multiple levels global, regional, national, sub-national - that are reshaping not merely access to landed resources but the very bases of authority, livelihood, ownership and citizenship.",

        "abstractNote": "Humans have lived alongside and interacted with wild animals throughout evolutionary history. Even though wild animals can damage property, or injure humans and domesticated animals, not all interactions between humans and wildlife are negative. Yet, research has tended to focus disproportionately on negative interactions leading to negative outcomes, labelling this human–wildlife conflict. Studies have identified several factors, ranging from gender, religion, socio-economics and literacy, which influence people's responses to wildlife. We used the ISI Web of Knowledge database to assess quantitatively how human–wildlife interactions are framed in the scientific literature and to understand the hypotheses that have been invoked to explain these. We found that the predominant focus of research was on human–wildlife conflict (71%), with little coverage of coexistence (2%) or neutral interactions (8%). We suggest that such a framing is problematic as it can lead to biases in conservation planning by failing to consider the nuances of people's relationships with wildlife and the opportunities that exist for conservation. We propose a typology of human responses to wildlife impacts, ranging from negative to positive, to help moderate the disproportionate focus on conflict. We suggest that standardizing terminology and considering interactions beyond those that are negative can lead to a more nuanced understanding of human–wildlife relations and help promote greater coexistence between people and wildlife. We also list the various influential factors that are reported to shape human–wildlife interactions and, to generate further hypotheses and research, classify them into 55 proximate (correlates) and five ultimate (mechanisms) factors.",
